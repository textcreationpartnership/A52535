            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of God's Exiſtence.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>VVHoſoever ſhall view the World in the ſeveral Stages and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Time, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſerve, that there was never any Nation ſo overwhelm'd with Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm and Ignorance, but did readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was ſomething Superior to their own Nature; which had Power to hurt and to defend them: and in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to this Belief, they did aſcribe more than human Honours to their Demons; endeavouring alſo by their Prayers and Oblations, to make them Propitious, and Aſcribing all their Succeſs and Felicity, as well as their Calamities, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Diſpenſations of their Gods.</p>
            <p>'Tis true; the Notions they had of the Nature of theſe Gods were very groſs and abſurd, ſince they ſometimes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd them to dwell in certain Beaſts, in Brutes, in Plants, or Images made of Stone, Wood, and the like, believing them almoſt to be as many in Number as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100786:4"/>
their Worſhippers, and ſubject to the ſame Viciſſitudes and Diſtempers of Paſſions. But how abſurd ſoever they were in their Rites and Ceremonies, in this they did all agree, that ſuch Numens did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide over them, and were therefore to be approach'd with all Veneration and Humility; to be invok'd with all Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Conſtancy, and to be appeas'd with ſome kind of Expiations; all which being the concurrent Senſe of Mankind in all Ages, can be no other than the Law of Nature, and muſt be therefore of Eternal Truth, as being deriv'd from that one firſt and ſupream Cauſe which gave Nature its Exiſtence.</p>
            <p>I queſtion whether there were ever any who did abſolutely disbelieve the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a Deity, not admitting it in ſome degree or other. As for thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancients who were Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd for Atheiſts, ſuch as <hi>Diagoras, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and the like; 'Tis plain, that they only derided thoſe who were eſteem'd Gods in their own Times, who indeed had not the leaſt Pretenſion to Divinity. And as for thoſe who believ'd the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the World or of Matter, ſuch as <hi>Ariſtotle, Epicurus,</hi> and the like; though ſuch a Belief were utterly inconſiſtent with the Notions of a True God; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertherleſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100786:4"/>
they did in ſome inferiour manner or other believe the Exiſtence of Divine Beings. But whoſever they were of this Tribe, and whatſoever their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was; this is certain, that they could never erect themſelves into a Sect, nor make any conſiderable Body of Men to be of their Perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>And as for our Modern Atheiſts or Scepticks, as they are known to be Men whoſe Natural Improvements are but ordinary, conſiſting only in Boldneſs and ſome little Gallantries of Wit; ſo is it as well known, that they are Men of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and Flagitious Lives; and that what they teach, is not ſo much their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as their Deſign; not what they think, but what they wiſh ſhould be: For could they make the Being of a God, or (what amounts to the ſame thing) his Providential Regiment of the World, but diſputable, there would be ſome Colour they think for their Licentious Courſes, to which their Lives are Proſtituted: And yet there was never any Man of Parts who has profeſſedly impugn'd the Being of a God, only by ſome oblique and ſide Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches they have adventur'd to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him in his Prerogatives, either in denying his Providence, by reaſon of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100786:5"/>
ſome ſeeming Incongruities in ſecond Cauſes; or admitting his Providence, they endeavour in the next Place, to make his concurrence with Human A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, to lay a neceſſity upon the Will for the commiſſion of Evil Actions, and by this means, they impugn his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or laſtly, by denying the Souls Immortality, or a ſtate of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, they labour to deſtroy his Juſtice; but of theſe Points more hereafter. For the preſent, 'tis worth our Conſideration, what ſome have excellently well obſerv'd, That Men of this Denomination, will be ever talking of their Opinion, as if they fainted in it within themſelves, and would be glad to be ſtrengthned by the conſent of others.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Belief and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> we are carefully to Conſider, what there was in their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worſhip, which was founded in the Law of Nature, and what it was which depended upon the Will and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Worſhipper. That which was founded in the Law of Nature, and in which they did all agree, was this; That there was ſome Superiour Power which did obſerve their Actions; which did govern all the Occurrences of Life,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100786:5"/>
and was Author of all the Good and Evil which did happen to them.</p>
            <p>From this Belief of the Power and Providence of their Gods, they formed to themſelves two Internal Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <hi>viz.</hi> Love and Fear; as alſo two External Acts, to wit, Invocation and Worſhip. Now this Worſhip conſiſted chiefly in theſe Duties: Firſt, Veneration and Honour: Secondly, Oblations, which were either Expiatory to appeaſe the Anger of their Gods, and make them Propitious; or elſe to teſtifie their Thanks and Gratitude for the Bleſſings they receiv'd; all which flowing Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from a belief they had of their Gods, and that they were the Original of Good and Evil, and conſequently of Rewards and Puniſhments, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonſtration, that they did all meet in thoſe general Notions, wherein the Worſhip of the True God was moſt concern'd.</p>

            </head>
            <p>NOw he that ſhould give a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or Hiſtory of the Heathen Gods, might himſelf have hopes to be of the Number of them, by doing a Work more laborious and difficult, than many of thoſe for which ſome of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were Deified: Their Number (as <hi>Varro</hi> Reports) amounted to no leſs than Thirty thouſand, and ſo Prodigious are the Stories that are reported of them, that even the falſe Deities ſeem to be both Infinite and Incomprehenſible, no leſs than the True one.</p>
            <p>Not therefore to run our ſelves into a Labyrinth of endleſs and headleſs Fables, we may curſorily obſerve; that as all the Heathen Gods had their Original aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd them, ſo alſo that they were Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal too; and that the Foundation upon which after Ages built their Worſhip of them, was laid in the Opinion they had of the Benefits Men receiv'd from them whilſt they lived on Earth; Thus <hi>Bacchus, Serapis,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> were held
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100786:6"/>
for Deities, as being reported to have been the firſt Planters of Corn and Wine; or ſuch, who in Times of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laid up thoſe Proviſions, by which future Dearths were ſupply'd. All In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Arts and Manufactures were aſcrib'd to <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Vulcan;</hi> of Navigation to <hi>Neptune;</hi> and of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Muſick to <hi>Apollo.</hi> Upon which account alſo it was, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Conſecrated ſo many Beaſts, believing that the Benefit they receiv'd from them, did proceed from a certain kind of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Divinity, by which they were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated or directed. Amongſt which there was none held in greater Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the Bird <hi>Ibis,</hi> for ſhape much like a Crane; for ſo it was, that theſe Birds fed altogether upon the Serpents which the <hi>African</hi> Winds, at certain Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, brought in vaſt quantities from the Deſerts of <hi>Lybia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought furthermore to Conſider, the Authors from whom we have theſe Traditions of the Heathen Gods, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ancient Poets, ſuch as <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Heſiod, Aratus, Theognis,</hi> &amp;c. All which were by after Ages called <hi>Vates</hi> or Enthuſiaſts, as pretending to ſpeak by Rapture, and with a Poetick Spirit, by which they mixt any Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100786:7"/>
Fictions of their own furious Brains, with whatſoever former Ages had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to them. So that to beget the greater Admiration, they thought it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to invent ſuch Stories as ſhould ſeem moſt Prodigious. Now theſe Poets being the only Writers, in whoſe Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is Regiſter'd whatſoever relates to the Hiſtories of the Gods; 'twas no wonder, that ſo great a medly of Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Incongruities ſhould caſt ſuch a Miſt on future Ages, as the Wit and Induſtry of the moſt Learned Men could never diſſipate; but by their Comments, Conjectures, and various Readings, they have rather rendred former Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more incredible and perplex'd.</p>
            <p>Of all the Heathen Gods, <hi>Jupiter</hi> was eſteem'd Supream, as being the Father of moſt of them, and the Fountain of that Power and Vertue, for which every one of them was worſhipped. We read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of many <hi>Jupiters,</hi> but of two more Eminent than the reſt; of which, one was born upon the Mountain of <hi>Ida</hi> in <hi>Creete,</hi> as ſome, or upon the Mountain <hi>Dictamnus,</hi> as others affirm. The other <hi>Jupiter</hi> was born in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Mountain <hi>Olympus;</hi> ſo that the Actions of the one being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attributed to the other, has been
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100786:7"/>
the occaſion of great Confuſion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he of <hi>Creete</hi> ſeems to have been the ſo much Celebrated, and to have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the Atchievments of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jupiters:</hi> He was ſaid to have been the Son of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Rhea,</hi> and to have deliver'd his Father from the Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Titans;</hi> nevertheleſs, <hi>Saturn</hi> upon the Prediction of the Oracle, that he ſhould be depos'd by his Sons, thought to have deſtroy'd them; and of this Reſolution <hi>Jupiter</hi> having notice, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his Father, which Poets expreſs'd by thruſting him into Hell. After this, <hi>Jupiter</hi> and his two Brethren, <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pluto,</hi> made a Tripartite diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire; <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as being the ſtrongeſt, choſe the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts, which was called <hi>Olympus</hi> or Heaven; <hi>Pluto</hi> had the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> which in the Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Poets regarded the ſetting Sun, or Region of Night, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Inferi,</hi> whilſt <hi>Neptune</hi> had the middle or Maritime Parts for his Lot. The Power of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s firſt Government, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Petty Tyrants (which were alſo called Giants) as alſo his Juſtice in the Sanction of wholſom Laws, was that which made him to be worſhipped for a God in after Ages: Notwithſtanding being for ſome time ſettled in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100786:8"/>
Throne, he indulg'd himſelf in all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures and Paſſions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted infinite Rapes and Diſorders, as appears from the Records of the Poets.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe who have written of the Heathen Gods, ſome there are who make their Hiſtory to be ſymbolical, and to repreſent Nature: By <hi>Jupiter</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Aether;</hi> by <hi>Neptune</hi> the Element of Water; by <hi>Vulcan</hi> Fire; and the Earth by <hi>Ops</hi> or <hi>Cybele;</hi> though others whilſt they make <hi>Saturn</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be the Son of <hi>Coelum</hi> or <hi>Veſta,</hi> ſeem to pitch upon the better Original of the Heathen Gods, as alſo of all other Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But waving the Fancies of Poets and Mythologiſts, this is certain; that as Men did expreſs their Adoration by ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rites and Myſteries of Religion, ſo we ſtill find them Invoking <hi>Jupiter</hi> as the Author of all their Bleſſings, and as the Supream Protector and Governour of all human Affairs. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was, that the <hi>Ammonii,</hi> a People of <hi>Lybia,</hi> repreſented <hi>Jupiter</hi> with Rams Horns on his Head; which Fiction of theirs had its Original from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (of which the <hi>Ammonii</hi> were a Colony) who in their Hiroglyphick Devices made the Ram to be the Symbol of Fecundity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100786:8"/>
and Strength; which ſuited well with the Notions they had of the Strength and Power of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Plenty deriv'd from him.</p>
            <p>But as Men began to be more improv'd by Knowledge, and to be more reform'd and poliſh'd in their Lives; in the ſame meaſure ſtill we may obſerve them to have been more and more averſe to the Stories and Traditions of their Gods: Upon which Account it was, that <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> were branded with the Character of Atheiſts; not becauſe they did disbelieve the Exiſtence of a Deity, but becauſe they derided thoſe who were falſly accounted Gods in the Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liv'd. But <hi>Socrates</hi> being in high Eſteem for Wiſdom, and more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for his Diſ-belief of the Heathen Gods, was put to Death for his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that 'tis no wonder if <hi>Plato,</hi> and thoſe who follow'd him, having ſuch an Example of <hi>Athenian</hi> Cruelty before their Eyes, became more Timorous and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in expreſſing their own Sentiments, for the moſt part ſpeaking of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to avoid the Puniſhments of the Bigotted Magiſtrate. And although <hi>Plato</hi> in his Books <hi>de Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi> which were to be communicated to the Vulgar, ſpake after the Stile which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100786:9"/>
was then in uſe; yet writing to <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> he tells him how he ſhould know when he was ſerious or no: <hi>For when I</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epiſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>am ſerious,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I always preface my Writings by the Invocation of one God; but when otherwiſe, of many.</hi> He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently calls God, the Father of the Univerſe; the Beginning and End; by whom and for whom all things are made; the Supreme Governour of all things which are or ſhall be; and the Idea of all that's Good.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Romans</hi> they us'd more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and boldneſs than the <hi>Greeks</hi> in theſe Diſcourſes; ſo that <hi>Tully,</hi> (who was an Academick, or one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s School) never uſes the Name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but tells us, That <hi>God himſelf cannot otherwiſe be underſtood of us, but as a certain Spirit free;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Tuſc. Quaeſt.</note> 
               <hi>ſegregated from all mortal Compoſition; ſuch as underſtands and moves all things, being it ſelf alſo endow'd with an eternal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity.</hi> In like manner <hi>Seneca,</hi> one of the greateſt Luminaries amongſt the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> never talks of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but uſes the word <hi>Deus,</hi> or God always in the ſingular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has the Exemplary of all things within himſelf, comprehending in his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Seneca, Epiſ. 65.</note> 
               <hi>Mind both the Number and Meaſures of whatſoever things are to be done.</hi> And a little after, ſhewing, that God is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100786:9"/>
and Author of all things, ſo the End propos'd by him, is nothing but his Goodneſs; and from thence concludes, That he hath made every thing the beſt that might be. From which, and many the like Paſſages, we are made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Notions they had of God were true and ſolid, being taken from thoſe Incommunicable Attributes or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, which are eſſential to the Divine Nature.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Attributes of God.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOw the Attributes of God are either abſolute, or ſuch without which the Divine Nature cannot be apprehended to ſubſiſt; or Relative and ſuch as regard his Creatures. Amongſt his abſolute Attributes or Properties, the firſt is his Eternity, or his being without beginning or end: For ſhould he have a beginning, then could he not be God, but muſt be inferiour to and after that from whom he had his beginning: but this includes a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; therefore the Antecedent alſo is impoſſible. And as the Nature of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100786:10"/>
God excludes all poſſibility of having a Superiour from whom it may derive its being; ſo alſo do's it exclude all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ending: For whatſoever ſhould put an end to its being muſt have greater power and ſtrength than it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the latter Power muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that of God; but this is alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. In the next place 'tis eſſential to the Divine Nature to be infinite in Perfection: For ſhould his Perfection be finite and bounded, he might yet be more perfect, by having further degrees of Perfection ſuperadded; for to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is finite there may be made Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since therefore there can be no Addition made to God's Perfections, they muſt be infinite; nothing but what is infinite being uncapable of further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or acceſs.</p>
            <p>Another Property eſſential to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is his Immenſity, or his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Nature which cannot be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by any imaginary ſpace, how vaſt ſoever: For ſhould there be any Ambient or Imaginary ſpace ſurrounding God, then would he ceaſe to be moſt perfect: For ſhould he fill all Spaces, he would be more powerful and perfect than when he is confin'd to ſome; as we ſee the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Power is greater than the Regal, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100786:10"/>
extending it ſelf over a wider Circuit. Now that any thing ſhould be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than God, or that he might be more perfect than he is, is utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the very Nature and Being of God.</p>
            <p>And as he is Immenſe, ſo muſt he be Omnipreſent, ſince there can be no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ſpace whatſoever aſſignable, which he do's not fill; and then if he be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, he muſt alſo be Omniſcient; there being nothing done or poſſible to be done in any point of ſpace whatſoever to which he is not preſent: nay, he muſt have a Knowledge or Preſcience of all future Actions whatſoever<hi>:</hi> For all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Actions muſt derive their Being from him firſt; ſo that God having a fore-knowledge of whatſoever he himſelf ſhall hereafter do, muſt have the ſame fore-knowledge alſo of whatſoever thing ſhall require his Concurrence. Now that God has a fore-knowledge of whatſoever he himſelf ſhall do is evident, otherwiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might fall out contingently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected to him; which implies Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ignorance, and ſo not conſiſtent with the Nature and Eſſence of God. The laſt Property eſſential to the Divine Nature, is, That he muſt be One: For ſhould there be more, One could not be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100786:11"/>
of infinite Perfection, as wanting the Perfection of the other: Nay, it could have no Divine Perfection, the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an infinite, and conſequently all Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Relative Attributes of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as regard his Creatures, are his Goodneſs, his Juſtice, his Veracity, and the like; all which being agreed to by all to appertain to the Divine Nature in the higheſt perfection poſſible, and being ever attributed by the Heathens to their Deities how falſe ſoever they were, there is no Place left for Reaſon to prove what by its own clearneſs is as undemonſtrable as any firſt Principle whatſoever. Theſe then are ſome of the Attributes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature: To enumerate all is paſt the Abilities of any poor mortal and finite Creature; for they are indeed above num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, only ſuch as I have already touch'd upon are ſufficient to evince the Truth of his Exiſtence to whom they do belong; and of thoſe which may be rank'd under this Head, the firſt and principal which does occur to our Conſideration is that Noble Attribute of Gods being the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS for thoſe who held the Eternity of the World, or of matter, we may obſerve of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that in the Courſe of his Reaſonings, (how much ſoever he did comply with the Cuſtoms of the times he liv'd in, and with his own private Paſſions,) he was forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Operations of Nature into a firſt Mover: And in his Book <hi>De Mundo,</hi> written in his riper Age, and dedicated to <hi>Alexander,</hi> he tells us, That the World and Order of the Univerſe was conſerv'd by God; and that there was nothing in the World of which he ſtood in need; that he was the Father of the Gods, as well as of Men; and the Producer, as well as the Preſerver of all thoſe things of which the World was made; not by way of commixture with them; but that this Power and Providence of his reſiding in the Heavens, extended it ſelf to all things, and mov'd the Heavens, with the Sun and Moon, ballancing and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth; and providing, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing ſhould act according to its Nature. In like manner <hi>Epicurus</hi> his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100786:12"/>
Opinion was as unſtable and fluctuating as his Atoms. For even <hi>Lucretius,</hi> his beſt Commentator, was forc'd to acknowledge, that the World had a beginning; for had it been Eternal, we muſt needs have met with Monuments of greater Antiquity than the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> or the <hi>Theban</hi> War.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee whether what theſe Men granted, of an Eternal, Infinite, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Framer of the Univerſe be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with that Eternity of matter of which they dreamt 'twas made: Had there been an eternal and prae-exiſtent matter, then muſt that matter have been immutable; for though the things made out of it be ſubject to continual viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and corruptions, yet the matter muſt be ſtill the ſame as the Stone and Timber of which the Houſe is made, is the ſame ſtill for nature and eſſence as 'twas before. Now if that out of which the World was made, was Immutable and Eternal, then muſt it have thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of which the Divine Nature chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do's conſiſt: but if this cannot be granted, then muſt it be mutable; and then can it not be Eternal; for what's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal muſt of neceſſity endure the ſame for ever. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100786:12"/>
This Truth of the Exiſtence of a God, made ſuch deep Impreſſions on the minds of Men through all Ages, that even the Poets themſelves, ſo much abandon'd as they were to their own wanton Fictions, were ever and anon forc't to throw off their Masks, and to expoſe the bare-fac'd Truth. The places cited out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Greeks</hi> are known, and many: As the Paſſages alſo of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> in <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> No leſs remarkable are the <hi>Latins. Ovid</hi>'s firſt Book of his <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> ſeems nothing but a Paraphraſe upon <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis:</hi> As alſo <hi>Virgil</hi> in that Paſſage or Fiction of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his deſcent into Hell; <note place="margin">Lib. 6.

            <p>adding further, that 'twas not the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but Death which could make him certain, and without more ado he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on his march, never offering ſo much as once to ſalute <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

            <p>In ſhort; whoſoever ſhall conſider, what the wiſeſt of the Heathen ſpake concerning a Deity, though they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed the word <hi>(Jupiter)</hi> as being a Name moſt known to the Vulgar, (yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein, (as I have ſaid) to the Stile and Cuſtoms of the Times in which they liv'd.) Nevertheleſs, the Deſcriptions they made, could belong to none but to the only True and Immortal God: For could that <hi>Jupiter</hi> be thought by them to be <hi>Hominum Sator at<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100786:13"/>
his Birth, as now it is? Could he be the Father of thoſe who were born before himſelf? Or could he give Immortality and Divinity to others, who could not preſerve himſelf from Death? Could he be the juſt and upright Governour of the World, who in his Life time committed ſo many Murders, Rapes, and Inceſts, and after his fictitious Tranſlation, ceas'd not to have his <hi>Ganymede,</hi> and to be employ'd about nothing more than to get Fuel for his Luſt? The groſſeſt Heathen could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe this, much leſs ſo many Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Learned Men amongſt them, of whom we read ſo much in prophane Story.</p>
            <p>Some are of Opinion, that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which the Heathen had of the True God, was not from any inſtinct of the Light of Nature, but from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; firſt to the Patriarchs, and from them, by way of Tradition deliver'd from Generation to Generation. The Ground for their Opinion is this; The moſt Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors whoſe Teſtimonies are cited in this Argument, are <hi>Zoroaſtres</hi> and <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus:</hi> The former is ſaid to have lived about the beginning of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Empire, and is by ſome ſuppos'd to have been the Son or Nephew of <hi>Ham.</hi> Whoever he was, <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes him <note place="margin">Tract. de Iſid. &amp; Oſer.</note> to have liv'd many Ages before the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>

As for <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus,</hi> he was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and of the greateſt Antiquity. In the Works which bear his Name, he ſeems to ſpeak as clearly of the Divine Myſteries as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf: Now the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were ever accounted, by all Prophane as well as Sacred Hiſtorians, to have been the moſt Ancient of all Nations; and we find in Scripture, that 'twas with theſe Nations the Patriarchs had greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: For <hi>Abraham</hi> liv'd for ſome time amongſt the <hi>Chaldees</hi> and in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Children of <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo with their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſojourn'd for ſome Ages: 'Twas no wonder then, that theſe two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould have ſo early a knowledge of Sacred Myſteries, as alſo of all other kind of Learning. From <hi>Egypt</hi> it was that the <hi>Greeks</hi> took their Light; <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the moſt Ancient Author amongſt them, viſited <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſearch'd into all their Sacred Records. Next after him was <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who not only travell'd into
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100786:14"/>
               <hi>Egypt,</hi> but into <hi>Chaldea</hi> alſo; and 'twas from <hi>Pythagoras</hi> chiefly that <hi>Plato</hi> took his Notions; as the Poets from <hi>Orpheus:</hi> ſo that the nearer they were to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the better always were their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.</p>
            <p>But whatſoever knowledge the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had by this way of Tradition, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that they could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much Light too from the Book of Nature<hi>:</hi> For Reaſon tells us, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever has a Beginning, muſt have it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from it ſelf, or from ſome other; not from it ſelf, for then muſt it have had an Exiſtence before it had an Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; the thing which produces ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being ever before that which is produc'd. But if it has its beginning from ſomething elſe, and that from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſo on; we muſt either make an Infinite Progreſs in Natural Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is utterly impoſſible; for no Infinite can actually be made up of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Actions; or we muſt at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all into one firſt Cauſe, which in it ſelf is without beginning, which can be no other than God.</p>
            <p>Let a Man turn himſelf which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſes, he ſhall find a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe of Creatures before his Eyes: He ſees the Earth producing every Living
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100786:15"/>
thing; and Plants in their Seaſon, and yielding all things uſeful for the Life of Man. He ſees the Heavens beautified with innumerable Stars of vaſt Bulk and Purity; he ſees thoſe Glorious Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Sun and Moon; he ſees all theſe Celeſtial Bodies, how they are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and perpetual in their Motion, moſt unchangeable in their Natures, and of wonderful Influence upon the World. And although he himſelf may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be an Abridgment of it, yet is he not able of himſelf to produce the leaſt Inſect; and whatſoever he does, it is done only by application of one thing to another, being altogether Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant himſelf of the manner how they perform their Operations; from whence he cannot but conclude, that there is ſomething infinitely more Powerful and Noble than himſelf, which firſt gave a Being to ſo many vaſt and beautiful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But when he ſhall conſider their ſubſervency to one another, and the juſt Oeconomy of the Univerſe, he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an Infinite Wiſdom alſo, which does diſpoſe and govern all things in the World; which Conſideration leads us forwards to Diſcourſe of the Divine Providence.</p>

            <p>FRom hence, that God is the Creator and firſt Cauſe of all things, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows naturally, that he is the Preſerver of them alſo, and that he does diſpoſe of all Things according to his own Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Pleaſure. For God (as it hath been already prov'd) being Preſent to all the Actions of his Creatures, ſo that nothing can be effected without his concurrence; and having alſo from all Eternity, a foreſight of whatſoever ſhall be done, it cannot be but that God muſt have ſome good Ends, in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he concurs to, ſuch as is beſt known to his own Infinite Wiſdom, (though ſuch Ends be for the moſt part far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe propos'd by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) where making one and the ſame Action to be the Inſtrument of farther Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is that which is call'd Providence; which becauſe it is a Point wherein the Power and Wiſdom of God does moſt diſcover it ſelf, and wherein we are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd, it will require to be more

diſtinctly treated of under theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. 1. Of Nature in General, and the ſubſervency of things to one another. 2. Of human Affairs, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Publick or Civil Government. 3. Of human Affairs in particular, or the ſpecial Concerns of Private Men.</p>
            <p>And firſt for the greater World; if we look upwards, the Heavens declare God's Almighty Power. Beſides, the Sun, Moon, and the other Planets, all which have a known Influence upon the whole Courſe of Nature, we cannot but take notice of thoſe numberleſs Stars which adorn the upper Firmament of Heaven, each of which is far bigger than the Earth: how Immenſe and Capacious then muſt that Region of <hi>Aetherbe</hi> in which they move and ſwim; all which, together with the Heavens themſelves, are in perpetual and moſt regular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, making their whole Circuit in the ſpace of Twenty four-hours, with that prodigious ſwiftneſs, that every Point of the <hi>Aequator</hi> in the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> or higheſt Firmament, does move above <note place="margin">Vide Clau. in Sphaer.

Num. 22.</note> a Hunderd thouſand Miles every Minute, as is ſufficiently prov'd by Aſtronomical Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>If we look before us upon the Earth on which we tread, we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100786:16"/>
how Fruitful it is in all ſorts of Animals and Vegetables; what great diverſity of Trees, what delicate Fruits may we obſerve to iſſue from the ſame Soil, together with an infinite variety of Flowers, moſt admirable for Colour, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Smell, and affecting all our Senſes with Wonder and Delight, whilſt our Reaſon entertains it ſelf with a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearch after the Cauſes of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; and what it is that does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh every Species, and from whence they are impreſs'd with ſuch different Vertues and Beauty. The divers kinds of Herbs, which we ſee naturally to grow upon the ſame Spot of Ground, is a thing which cannot but raviſh the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, conſidering that ſome of them are good for Food, others of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe in Medicines; others again moſt refreſhing in their Odours, which are yet ſo different, that one has no ſimilitude with another, and yet all theſe Herbs are in their ſmell moſt Fragrant, of a lively and unſpotted Vertue, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified with numberleſs minute Strings or Fibres; by which, as by ſo many little Veins, they ſuck in their Juice and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment from the Earth; all which in a little flux of time ſeem to die, when by ſhedding only a few Grains or Seeds
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100786:17"/>
revive and ſuperannuate; and ſo by a perpetual Succeſſion of new Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they repair their paſt decays, and by dying they endure throughout all Ages, and become Immortal. And yet this Earth out of which all theſe Bleſſings are produc'd, by all the diſcovery we can make, is nothing but a cold inſipid Maſs of Matter in appearance, being grateful to no Senſe, and deſtitute of warmth and all prolifick Vertue.</p>
            <p>If we paſs into the Region of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, we may obſerve how ſome are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with ſingular Strength and Beauty; others with great Sagacity; others are moſt docile and ſerviceable to Man for Neceſſity and Pleaſure: We may obſerve alſo, how ſollicitous and tender they are for the Preſervation and Nouriſhment of their young, though they be otherwiſe moſt ſavage in their Natures; and how every Creature before it can ſtand or ſee, does yet know the way to the Teat.</p>
            <p>I cannot think it improper (how tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial ſoever it may ſeem) to relate what I have ſome times, with great Pleaſure and Admiration, obſerv'd of a young Whelp not Six Weeks old, which having eaten ſufficiently of what Meat was given it, took the remainder and hid it, by ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſo much Earth with his Noſe and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100786:17"/>
Feet as cover'd it; and yet, take a Child of Two or three years old, tho' it be endu'd with a Rational Soul, and after it has fill'd it ſelf, it will caſt the reſt away. Whence now is it, that a poor young dumb Bruit ſhould have the knowledge and foreſight of its future wants, and lay up what is ſuperfluous to ſupply after hunger? It could not learn this by Imitation or Inſtruction; no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, we ſay then it has it by Inſtinct, or that this Provident Inclination is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd on it by God the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who takes more than ordinary care for the preſervation of ſuch poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which otherwiſe would periſh for want of ſuccour. In like manner we may obſerve, that take a young Whelp, if it can but ſee, and put it on a Table, it will creep or craul about the Edge or Borders of it, and there cry, not ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to go further. But take a young Child of Two or three years old, and put it on a Table in like manner, it will certainly run forwards without fear, till it fall down headlong, and perhaps break its Neck. Here then we may juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, how ſuch a little poor ſucking Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſhould underſtand its weakneſs and danger; and by the eſtimate it makes of the diſtance of the Ground under it, finds
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100786:18"/>
it too great, and not to be ventur'd on but with certain Peril. This can be no other than God's Providential care, who alſo takes the like Providential care for the ſafeguard of Man under all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Life, as we ſhall ſee by and by.</p>
            <p>If we look upon the Fowls of the Air, we cannot but obſerve, with what ſymmetry every little Bird builds its Neſt, how cautious in chooſing a Place of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and how vigilant and watchful is it to delude the ſight of Man, when it flies towards it? Whence had theſe little Creatures this wonderful Art of framing ſuch curious and elaborate Receptacles wherein to lay their Off-ſpring? They never could acquire it by imitation, or by the direction of their Dams, being in the Shell only, and in the Bowels of their Mothers when ſuch like Neſts were fram'd. Nay, even the leaſt Inſect of Nature does not fail to create Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo that the leſſer the Animal, the greater is the Wonder and Power by which 'twas form'd. The Providence and Induſtry of the Ant is admirable, and ſo is that of the Bee, a Creature certainly above the Commendation of Poets, when we reflect a little upon their Natures; how indefatigable are they in their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100786:18"/>
how careful againſt future Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; how wonderful in their Order; how admirable in contriving their Frame of little Cells; no way detrimental to the Herbs and Flowers they feed on, and moſt uſeful and profitable to Man by their Wax and Honey. The leaſt Inſect that flies before our Eyes, how vile ſoever, has notwithſtanding all the Parts of Life, Reſpiration and Nutrition; and all the Organs of Senſe, and Parts for Motion; all which are form'd with ſuch accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delicacy, as far ſurpaſſes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoveries of the accuteſt Oculiſt.</p>
            <p>The wonderful Care and Providence of Almighty God for the preſervation of his Creatures, is yet more viſible from hence; That ſuch of them as move ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo leſs able to fly from danger, are arm'd either with pointed Quills or Pricks, as Porcupines and Hedge-hogs; or elſe with Shells, as we may obſerve in the Tortoiſe, Snails, and divers kinds of Fiſh. The Creatures which are more timorous are generally the ſwifteſt, as Hares and Dear; or elſe by herding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they find ſome ſecurity in their Number. The like alſo we may obſerve of Birds; whereas both Birds and Beaſts of Prey are much fewer in number, living in Dens, and are rarely ſeen but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100786:19"/>
ſingly, which otherwiſe would be very deſtructive to their fellow Bruits, and alſo dangerous to Man.</p>
            <p>But not to expatiate over the ſeveral Tribes of Creatures, we will for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſake limit our Obſervation to ſome general Proviſions of Nature, which will more than inſtruct us of the great Wiſdom and Providence of God, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Univerſe, and in ſupplying the Wants and Neceſſities of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If we conſider the Situation and Temper of the Northern parts of the World, and ſuch as lie towards the Pole, we may obſerve how all things are expos'd to the Rigours and Severities which are deriv'd from the Extremities of Froſt and Snow; all which Miſeries are abundantly reliev'd by the comfortable Proviſion of vaſt Woods, which do not only furniſh Men with Food, by nouriſhing all ſorts of Beaſts and Birds of Game in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, but do in a ſingular manner alſo provide for them againſt the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of thoſe Regions, by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary plenty of Fuel; and by breeding all ſuch Beaſts, whoſe rich and warm Furs are not only a defence againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the Climate; but by being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported into the other Parts of the World, do purchaſe whatſoever is uſeful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful for the Life of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100786:19"/>
If we regard the hotter Regions which lie under the ſcorching Sun, ſuch as thoſe betwixt the Tropicks, and which contain almoſt half of the <hi>Terraqueous</hi> Globe, we ſhall find the Parching Beams of Noon to be temper'd with the cool and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Breezes which blow conſtantly at that Seaſon of the day; and even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the Equinoctial, during the time of the greateſt heats, there fall ſuch vaſt quantities of Rain, as do not only render that Climate very temperare, and the Air refreſhing, but do render the Soil alſo in moſt Places as fertile and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding as is any where to be found upon the ſurface of the whole Earth. Beſides; the equality of Night and Day, and the interpoſition of the Earth in its whole Diameter, by reaſon of the direct riſing and ſetting of the Sun, as they are the Effects of its near approach, ſo do they in a wonderful manner mitigate and balance the intolerable Inconveniencies which otherwiſe would follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egypt</hi> is a Country where it ſeldom or never Rains, and conſequently lying in that degree of Heat, it could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, were it not in a ſtupendious manner refreſh'd and water'd by the <hi>Nile,</hi> which overflowing all the Country at ſuch time as it lies expos'd to the greateſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100786:20"/>
heats, does not only qualifie the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of that Seaſon, but makes the Country alſo to be the moſt fruitful and delicious, that is to be found in the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table World: The ſame is reported alſo of <hi>Ganges,</hi> and other Rivers of <hi>India.</hi> Nay, even in the Deſarts and ſcorching Plains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> how wonderfully has Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the exigence of Man by Camels, a Creature whoſe tender Hoof receives no injury from the burning Sands, and by being able to bear great Burthens, and to go ſeveral days without drinking, is moſt ſerviceable to Travellers, and ſuch as Trade in thoſe Parts, where any other Beaſt would inevitably periſh through want of Water.</p>
            <p>What is reported of <hi>Ferraria,</hi> an Iſland belonging to the <hi>Canaries,</hi> ſeems miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; <note place="margin">Got. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus <hi>his</hi> Ind. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> the Soil of it is as dry and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated as can any where be ſeen, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that not a drop of freſh Water can be found any where, unleſs ſome few Springs upon the Sea Coaſt, from whence the Inhabitants can have no benefit, by reaſon of too great a diſtance, which want is ſtrangely reliev'd by God, there growing in the midſt of the Iſle a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tree of no great bulk, and always green, the like whereof is to be found no where in the Univerſe. The Tree is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100786:20"/>
envelop'd with a thick Miſt or Cloud, ſuch as does neither diminiſh nor increaſe; from the Leaves whereof, which are long in ſhape like thoſe of a Wallnut-Tree, there diſtills perpetually ſuch a quantity of pure Chryſtal Water, as equals that of the moſt plentiful Springs; all which being receiv'd into Ciſterns and other Veſſels, ſerves the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of the whole Iſland, both for the Inhabitants and their Cattel. No leſs ſingular and beneficial is the Palm-tree, though more commonly known by its rare Benefits and Vertues, as affording excellent Wine, Fruits, Vinegar, Thread, and Leaves always green, and ſuch as ſerve for a durable covering to Houſes againſt all Injuries of the Weather; ſo that 'tis with juſt reaſon, that this Tree is made the Symbol of Vertue, not only for its fam'd Power of reſiſting whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does oppoſe it, but for its ſingular Nature and Qualities, being ſuch as can ſupply all the Neceſſities of Life. If <hi>Lumbardy</hi> abound with rich Wines and Paſtures which the <hi>Alpes</hi> want, yet do theſe enjoy a cooler and more healthy Air; the poverty and barrenneſs of their Soil will never invite their Neighbours to make War upon them; and in caſe they ſhould be attack'd, their high Snowy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100786:21"/>
Rocks and Mountains would prove a good ſecurity againſt the Invaſion; ſo that the Peace of the one may ſeem more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than the Plenty of the other: We may obſerve, how the moſt barren Rocks and Mountains of the World are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Rich with Marble, Ore, and many times with Chryſtal and Jewels of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value. We may obſerve alſo how the <hi>Southern</hi> Seas, though they are not ſo well ſtor'd with Fiſh as the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,</hi> yet do they abound with Coral and Pearls, which can in a manner pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe all other Riches.</p>
            <p>In a word, whoſoever ſhall attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurvey the Face of Nature from Pole to Pole, and from the riſing to the ſetting Sun, may eaſily diſcern, that whatſoever Inconveniencies any Place or Country is ſubject to, the ſame alſo doth enjoy ſome other Bleſſings equivalent to, or perhaps more beneficial than what they want; which cannot but proceed from the all Good and Wiſe Creator and Governour of the Univerſe; it being impoſſible, that ſo many and various Effects of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as lie before our Eyes, ſo Regular and Beautiful, ſo Curious and Uſeful, ſhould be the reſults of blind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning Chance. Let Stones, Timber, Iron, with the other Materials of building,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100786:21"/>
be ſhuffled and toſs'd together for Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Ages, they will never fall into the Form and Figure of a Houſe; and yet the Works of Art fall exceeding ſhort of thoſe of Nature; how then can't be imagin'd, that this great Machine of the World, which conſiſts of infinite variety of things, the leaſt of which ſurpaſſes the Productions of the moſt Induſtrious and Ingenious Artiſts, and where all the Parts hold that Analogy and Conformity to one another, as makes one univerſal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual harmony; I ſay, how is it poſſible, that all theſe things ſhould have their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal from Chance, and ſhould in ſuch an admirable manner be animated by Contingencies?</p>

            </head>
            <p>THis ſubſerviency of things to one another, is a Point which deſerves our further Conſideration, as being that which does exceedingly illuſtrate the Wonders and Order of a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The Sun as it is in it ſelf the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100786:22"/>
moſt Glorious of all viſible Creatures, ſo is it the moſt Beneficial too, when we ſhall conſider a little, the wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it has upon the Earth in its Courſe and Motion: For ſhould it keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to one Circle, a great part of the Earth would be burnt up, whilſt the remoter Regions would be deſolate, and lie covered perpetually with Ice. But by the Wiſdom of God it is ſo order'd, that all Places in their due Seaſons enjoy the benign and comfortable Influence of this glorious Luminary of the Day; for by its declination ſometimes Northward, and ſometimes Southward, in a juſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Courſe, it Creates that diſtinction of Seaſons through all the World, <hi>(viz.</hi> of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter) by which the Earth is render'd Fruitful, and furniſh'd with all thoſe Bleſſings and Comforts which every Seaſon does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: Which method, as it furniſhes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very living Creature with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and delightful to its Nature, ſo is it moſt recreative to the Spirits both of Man and Beaſt; the withdrawing of the Sun being as neceſſary for their Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by that reſt and ſleep which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on the Night, as its bright and warm Appearance is uſeful to the fruitions of Life, and to the ſeveral Labours and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100786:22"/>
Duties of the Day. How tir'd are we with the length perhaps of one Summers day? How unſupportable then would our Condition be, were we oblig'd to live but for a Month, perhaps in ſuch a Tenour and Courſe without Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? ſo that after the Heats and Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Summer, Nature calls for the cool refreſhments of Winter, and theſe again prepare our Appetites to taſte the Pleaſures of the Spring; ſo that by this perpetual Circle and Counterchange of Seaſons, we are always in a round or progreſs, to be reliev'd by freſh Comforts, and deliver'd from the Inconveniencies which would follow, by being confin'd to one certain and unchangeable ſtate of Nature. The like Obſervation might be made of the Moon and of the other Planets, all which are no leſs ſerviceable to the Earth in their ſeveral Periods and Revolutions.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; if we conſider that Tract of ſpace which lies betwixt the Heavens and the Earth, the Region of Clouds and Rain, of Winds and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we may obſerve likewiſe how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful theſe things are, though they ſeem to be nothing but the Excrementitious Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Evaporations of Nature. It is to the Winds we owe that Attemperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100786:23"/>
and Motion of the Air which is ſo conducing to Health; it is to the Winds we owe all the Bleſſings which are deriv'd from Navigation. Theſe Winds which ſeem to ſcatter where they blow, do Unite Nations in Alliance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and convey to us whatſoever rarity is to be found in any part of the Earth. The Clouds by their interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition betwixt the Sun and us, ſhelter us from the Injuries of its hotter Beams; and by diſtilling Showers of Rain upon the Ground, do render it moſt verdant and fruitful: And even the Thunder, which in all Ages has been lookt on as the effect of an offended Deity, and to have ſomething in it of Terrour and Prodigy, is yet beneficial, by diſpelling thoſe aduſt and gloomy Vapours which are incident to the Summer Seaſons.</p>
            <p>If we caſt our Eyes upon the Ocean, at the firſt aſpect it will appear to us to be a bottomleſs Gulf, of an unlimitted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, moſt hideous in its roaring, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon the Earth with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and threatning nothing but Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Ruine; And yet this great Abyſs and Expanſe of Waters, beſides the infinite plenty and variety of Fiſh, with other things, with which it does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, will upon a ſtricter view be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100786:23"/>
found to be the great Medium, by which Traffick and all Civil Correſpondence is ſupported, and the ſureſt boundaries and ſecurity to Kingdoms; ſo that whilſt it threatens to overwhelm, it does ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us from the ſudden Irruptions of foreign Invaſion; and beſides, it is that great and inexhauſtible Treaſure of Springs and Fountains which ſupply the Earth, and adorn it with Beautiful and Navigable Rivers.</p>
            <p>Some are of an Opinion, that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains have their Original from Rains, which falling from the higher Grounds, and meeting at laſt in ſome common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, make thoſe little Erruptions which we call Springs. This Opinion in ſome meaſure may be admitted, ſince we find that Springs dry up in times of great Drought, and then ſwell in times of Rain: But this is not the chief Cauſe of Fountains, for then the greateſt Springs would riſe in the lower Grounds; but we may obſerve generally, that they iſſue from the Sides, and ſometimes from the Tops of Mountains, where there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuch ſtores of collected Water, and where the Surface of the Earth is dry and barren; and where there is little or no over-hanging Ground, from whence ſuch Fountains may fall, and be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100786:24"/>
in ſuch a conſtant Current. They are deriv'd therefore from the Sea, from whence through the whole Bowels of the Earth there are a vaſt Number of ſubterraneous Channels or minute Paſſages (reſembling the Pores and Veins of the Body,) into which theſe Waters are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and through which they run; where meeting with thoſe ſulphureous Heats which occur every where through the Entrails of the Earth, they are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and aſcend (like the Vapours in a Limbeck) through all its Concavities and Veins, till meeting with the cold Air, which generally reſides on Mountains and in the Caverns of Rocks, they are there condens'd into Drops, which by diſtilling from the tops of theſe Grotto's, as from the Head of an Alimbeck, trickle down, and meeting in great Numbers, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate theſe little Currents, which at length forming a Paſſage through the ſides of the ſame Mountain, is that which we call Springs: Theſe Springs meeting together in greater numbers are form'd into Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, repleniſh'd with all variety of Fiſh; by which Rivers alſo the Earth is water'd and defended, and Commodities are convey'd from Place to Place with great eaſe and ſafety; all which Rivers keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Courſe into the Ocean from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100786:24"/>
whence they came, make a perpetual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and become the richeſt helps to Nature.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Earth on which we ſtand, we ſhall find the ſame Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Harmony betwixt the ſeveral Parts and Regions of it: The Northern Quarters of the World, as <hi>Sweden, Denmark, Norway</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> though they be deſtitute of rich Wines and fat Paſtures, abound with tall Trees fit for building, as alſo with Maſts, Pitch, Tar, (which are the things ſo neceſſary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation) together with Iron, Braſs and Copper, which are the Metals ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely uſeful in Peace and War, and which do in effect Command the World. Some Countries abound chiefly with Corn, others again with Wine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are proper only for Paſturage; ſo that the Wants of the one are not only ſuppliable by the Plenty of the other, but there is a certain kind of Alliance made by Nature betwixt Country and Country, from the Neceſſities they are under of being ſupply'd by one another. And even theſe Parts which of all others ſeem moſt deſtitute of the Bleſſings of Nature (as enjoying neither the Fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Land, nor are yet ſecure from the Violence and Inundation of the Sea,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100786:25"/>
but ſeem moſt expos'd to Dangers and Inconveniencies from both, by lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sand and Waſh, and open to the Winds) are by Divine Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence made the Richeſt and the moſt Beautiful Treaſures of the World, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Maritime Parts of the Low Countries, which Places do not only by their Commerce enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others to a Prodigy, but are alſo of that Power and Strength, as the greateſt Policy and Force are not able to ſubdue them.</p>
            <p>The grand Objection againſt God's Providence in the Government of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is taken from ſome irregularities which uſually occur in the Courſe of things. The Hopes and Expectations of a fruitful Spring, are many times fruſtrated by ſome unſeaſonable Winds or Blaſts; or by the ſudden inundation of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<hi>:</hi> We obſerve frequently whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to be overwhelm'd by the flowing in of the Sea; and fair Cities to be buried in Ruins by an Earth-quake. What Wrecks and Miſeries do ariſe at Sea from the Violence of Tempeſts and Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cances? What havock is there made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at Land amongſt Trees, and Edifices by the fury of Winds? Many Places have been ruin'd by Eruptions of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100786:25"/>
Fire; and whole Kingdoms have been brought to the utmoſt Extremity by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence. To this I anſwer:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That thoſe ſeeming Irregularities are very few and inconſiderable, when we reflect upon the whole Courſe and Syſtem of Nature, and do no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Care and Wiſdom of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, than the little Flaws and Blemiſhes we ſee uſually in the Stones of the nobleſt Fabricks, do detract from the Art and Ingenuity of the Architect: ſo that a building may be Beautiful, and hold an exact Sympathy in all its parts, though there may be found ſome Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes in the Timber, or here and there a Stone not ſo exactly poliſh'd.</p>
            <p>In the next place; The forementioned Irregularities, whatſoever they ſeem to be, are not yet of ſo great damage, but that the Benefit which attends them is many times greater. If the Labour and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the Induſtrious Husbandman be ſubject to Caſualties, the Reſidue will ever carry a greater Price, and ſtir up greater diligence; which in the end makes a full return: whereas Years of greateſt Plenty bring down the Fruits and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Earth to a low rate, and do both nouriſh Idleneſs, and tend to ſurfeit. If Fruitful Meadows be for a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100786:26"/>
time waſted by the diſorders of a Flood, yet the Injury is recompens'd by the rich Mud and Fatneſs it leaves upon the Earth; by which it becomes afterwards more Fertile and Luxuriant. The Countries which are moſt expos'd to the Irruptions of the Sea, are drawn by ſuch Misfortunes to truſt to their Ships; and by that means alſo become the wealthieſt Traders in the World. If Earth-quakes and Tempeſts ſubvert Houſes ſometimes; ſo by looſning the Roots of Trees, they exceedingly contribute to the furtherance and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Nature, and many times diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver new Treaſures. If ſtrong Winds be ſometimes injurious, yet are they as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to us, not only by diſſipating thoſe Smells and Vapours, which many times infect the Air, but are generally the Fore-runners of great Serenity. The Places which are moſt ſubject to Sulphureous Eruptions are enrich'd by the Aſhes: And even the Peſtilence it ſelf, ſo great a ſlaughter as it ſeems to make of Mankind, is generally ſucceeded with Healthful Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For by ripening the Diſeaſes and Corruptions of Nature, and by drawing them into one common Sore or Iſſue, it leaves no Tabifick Matter or tainted Humours for future Diſeaſes to feed upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100786:26"/>
But in the laſt place; Whatſoever Diſaſters there be, which proceed from theſe and ſuch like Irregularities, they do not argue any Interruption or Defect in Nature, foraſmuch as they are derived from certain and natural Cauſes, tho they be detrimental ſometimes and hurtful to Men; ſo that they are rather to be look'd upon as Puniſhments, than as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Infirmities of Nature; the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which Proceedings betwixt God and Man will be more fully ſtated by and by.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Divine Providence in reſpect of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Affairs in General.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THus much briefly of Nature in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and of the ſubſerviency of things to one another: Proceed we in the next place to diſcourſe of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in relation to the Operations and Occurrences of Man; and this under a Two-fold Capacity: Firſt, Publick, in reſpect of Greater Bodies, or Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities. Secondly, Special and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as relating to the Actions and Courſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100786:27"/>
of every individual Perſon. Moreover, the Notion of Providence is Two-fold; the firſt is natural, by which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides all things neceſſary for the Life and Suſtenance of Man. The ſecond is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which may more properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Previding, being no other than the ſecret End propos'd by God for his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Man in all his Actions; which be they never ſo Irregular, Unjuſt, or Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from the Evil Ends propos'd by Men, are by the Divine Power and Wiſdom, made to be the Inſtruments of Good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Intention of ſecond Cauſes. Prophane Story is not ſo apt to illuſtrate this Point as Sacred Writ; for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: The End propos'd by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons in ſelling <hi>Joſeph</hi> was Revenge, God concurs with them in this Action, but upon other Ends, deſigning to make this unjuſt Act of theirs to become an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Preſervation, as appears from the wonderful Accidents through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Courſe of that Hiſtory; which Paſſage alſo was a Type of what befell our Lord and Saviour, who was villainouſly ſold, betray'd, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly put to death by the Jews, to all which God concurs, making this wicked Act of theirs to be the ſole Means for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Murderers, and all the World
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100786:27"/>
beſides, by that Atonement which was made for their Sins by the Precious Blood of his only Son. This Method is moſt Conſonant to the Nature of God, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible there ſhould be any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Demonſtration of his Divine Power and Goodneſs, than to be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Poiſon into a Cordial, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſafety out of that which would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be our ruin.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better underſtand the Cauſe and Reaſonableneſs of God's Operations with Men, I muſt leave my ordinary Road a little, and take up with the obſcure Traces and Niceties of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks; by premiſing ſome few Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which like the <hi>Poſtulata</hi> or <hi>Axioms</hi> in the Mathematicks muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted for the preſent, to avoid the long Digreſſions and Perplexities which would follow upon a particular Proof of each of them. And, 1. God from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity foreſees all future Actions of Men, his Omniſcience being a Noble Attribute and Branch of his Divine Nature. 2. This Fore-knowledge of God (tho' it imply a certainty of the Action) does not lay a neceſſity upon the Agent, no more than my fore-knowledge of the Sun's ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to morrow Morning is a neceſſary Cauſe of the Courſe and Riſing of that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100786:28"/>
Glorious Creature. 3. That God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Actions of Men, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſical or Moral: Phyſical, for as much as he by his Power is the Preſerver of every Creature in its Being and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and this Power extends it ſelf to all the Actions of Men, whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Spontaneous. 2. Moral, by propoſing Rewards and Puniſhments, as Motives to excite or to diſſwade from Action, adding ſometimes his Poſitive and Revealed Commands, together with his aſſiſting Grace, by the impulſe of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; but this is a Point which more properly concerns Divinity. 4. That God has given Man a freedom of Will, <hi>viz.</hi> a Power to chooſe or diſlike upon the apprehenſions he has of Objects: for Man otherwiſe would be nothing but a meer Machine, all whoſe Motions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regular or Irregular, Good or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, would be nothing but the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and direction of its Maker, and would be reputed all for the Acts of Man, becauſe God is pleas'd to produce them in his Preſence; which is all one as to ſay, that the Feracity of the Garden is an Act of the Water-pots, becauſe the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter does run through it, by which the Gardner does revive his Flowers. 5. That the apprehenſion which Man has
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100786:28"/>
of Objects, upon which he forms his Acts of choice or diſlike, being many times clouded by Ignorance, or miſguid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Irregular Paſſions, is that which betrays him to the commiſſion of Evil. 6. The Perpetration of which Evil is no further forth the Act of God, than that Man in his Exiſtence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in his Operations, muſt depend upon the Conſerving Power of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; ſo that God can no more be ſaid to be the Cauſe of Sin, than the Sea, whoſe Nature 'tis extinguiſh Fire, can be ſaid to be the Cauſe of the burning and ruin of ſome Cities, for as much as it ſupports and carries up the Ships, from whence came the Bombs and Fire-works which did the miſchief. From whence it follows alſo, that the commiſſion of Sin is a Moral Action, terminated in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forbidden, which may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood either of the Internal Act of the Will, propoſing a bad Object, or a bad End; or elſe of the External Action or Execution, which whether it contain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing poſitive in its Nature, is with great nicety diſputed; ſome diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the materiality of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the formality or obliquity, which is nothing but the regard which the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has to an unlawful Object. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100786:29"/>
they make to be Poſitive, the other a mere Privative, though this latter ſeem'd a little difficult: For Inſtance, this or that particular Act of murder, whether intended or executed, does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its Individuality and Being from the Object on which 'tis terminated; ſo that this particular Act or Action it ſelf, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the very Termination on ſuch an undue Object, and in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, they ſay, the very formality and obliquity of Sin. In the laſt Place, this propenſity in Actions, whether Good or Evil, whatſoever it be, is not of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Creature, ſince even by divine Power it cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible there ſhould be ſuch a thing as a Thought, without ſomething which thinks, and ſomething which is thought upon; or an Action without an Agent and an Object:) It is therefore of the Nature of a Relation, which can be ſaid only to have an improper and deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Reality, for as much as the Terms related are real Things.</p>
            <p>From theſe Points thus premiſed, ſome Rational anſwer may be given to ſuch Difficulties as ſhall occur in our further Conſideration of Divine Providence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Human Actions: Reſuming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſtribution which I made in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100786:29"/>
the beginning of this Chapter, we are firſt to conſider God's Providence in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to greater Bodies or Civil Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or as it extends it ſelf to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment and Revolutions of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. To prove this, we need no more, but to reflect upon the Nature and Attributes of God, who, as it hath been already demonſtrated, is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and gives Life and Power to every Creature in all its Motions and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Reaſonings they are fooliſh, when he endeavours to ſhew, that it is beneath the Grandure of a Deity to concern it ſelf in the Tranſactions of Men, and that the Multiplicity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Occurrences would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to that Tranquility which is ſo eſſential to that happy ſtate, where there is nothing but quiet and ſerenity. Theſe Notions of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſo ſoft and gentle, ſo ſmooth and inchanting, would ſuit well with the <hi>Elyſium</hi> of the Poets, or the Sultaneſſes of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> but will by no means conſiſt with the meaſures of Philoſophy, nor yet with the Maxims of Temporal Princes, from whence they ſeem to borrow their falſe and fading Colours. For amongſt the Grandees of the Earth, thoſe were ever accounted the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100786:30"/>
greateſt Heroes who were moſt active, as <hi>Hercules, Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> and the reſt; whilſt ſuch as abandon'd themſelves to Eaſe, Idleneſs and Tranquility, were moſt unhappy in their Government, and in the cloſe of their Lives expos'd to ſhame and ruin, and their Memories render'd infamous to all future Ages. A good Prince ought, if it were poſſible, to know the Neceſſities of every Subject of his in particular, and to relieve and protect him; which ſince he cannot do, being himſelf of a Finite Nature, and circumſcrib'd by his own Perſonal and Domeſtick Exigencies, it is his Duty to execute this Power by his Deputies and Miniſters, with their ſubordinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers, which, if they prove Diligent, Juſt, and Men of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Courage and Experience, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but render a Prince Glorious and Happy: And upon this Account it is, that Kings are call'd God's Vicegerents, and ſometimes gods themſelves, not from a ſupream and voluptuous Repoſe, or a reſty State and Majeſty, but from their Civil Omnipreſence and Ubiquity, by which, like Gods, they can do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite things at once, and be beneficial to all, by the aſſiſtance and influence of their under-Agents and Miniſters. From
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100786:30"/>
hence then, that God is the Sovereign Monarch of the Univerſe, and moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and glorious in his Station, it follows with Congruity, or rather with Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he muſt have a particular care of the Affairs of his Creatures; nor need he under-Officers to do this, being by his Nature preſent to all Places; nor can the multiplicity of Affairs obſtruct or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract a Power which is Omnipotent, and where the Execution is nothing but Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God does ſometime upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſions, and in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner uſe the Miniſtry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; nay even of men in ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, by giving them a ſupernatural Virtue to work Miracles, and this he does to demonſtrate his greater Power, in like manner, as it would demonſtrate a greater skill in a Maſter of Rhetorick, to make a ſtammering Ideot deliver an Harangue with good Grace and Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, than to pronounce the ſame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though according to the beſt Precepts and Geſtures of Art.</p>
            <p>From the Dictates of Reaſon paſs we on to the Practice of Nations; and here we ſhall find through all Ages of the World, how the wiſeſt and greateſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments did ever acknowledge their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100786:31"/>
welfare and dependance upon a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and Providential Power. The <hi>Romans,</hi> and before them the <hi>Greeks,</hi> thoſe great Maſters of Learning and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in all their weightieſt Conſultations whether of War or Peace, ſought ever to make Heaven Propitious, or at leaſt to underſtand its Will and Inclinations, by Conſulting of Oracles, by Victims, and by obſerving the Rites and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Augurs; which Cuſtoms of theirs, though in many things ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and converſant about falſe Gods, ſhew'd however the univerſal Belief they had of ſome Deity or Deities, which Preſided over and Govern'd all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. And in a further Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Perſwaſion and Gratitude, they offer'd Hecatombs, erected Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, hung up Votive Tables repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Benefits they receiv'd from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and inſtituted Anniverſary Games and Feaſts, with other Monuments, by which they labour'd to Celebrate and Perpetuate the Memory of ſuch Bleſſings. And upon this account alſo 'twas, that Providence was alſo repreſented (as in the Money of <hi>Antoninus Pius)</hi> by the Image of <hi>Janus,</hi> looking backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, towards paſt and future Things: But in the Medals of <hi>Hadrian</hi> ſhe is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100786:31"/>
as a Goddeſs, holding a Rod in her Right Hand, with a Globle at her Feet, Symbolizing thereby, that the World is ſubject to her, and govern'd by her Power.</p>
            <p>All the Ancients, whether Poets or Philoſophers, believ'd a Providence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Epicurus:</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Lucian</hi> ſhews himſelf an Epicure in nothing more <note place="margin">Lucian dial. inter Charon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> than this, witneſs his <hi>Jupiter Tragoedus,</hi> where in a diſputation held by <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and <hi>Dames</hi> before the Gods, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with the <hi>Epicurean</hi> againſt the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> in the denial of a Providence; and yet in another Place, in the Perſon of <hi>Menippus,</hi> he does expreſly ſay, that every one ſhall be judg'd according to the Actions of his Life, which cannot be unleſs the Gods be allow'd to have an Inſpection over them. But 'tis not to be wonder'd, that ſome ſhould be Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in the deductions of Speculation: Hence we have Inſtances of others who have deny'd the Evidence of Senſe. For <hi>Zeno</hi> deny'd Motion, <hi>Democritus</hi> Station, and a Third, That the Snow was white; which ſingular Extravagancies of Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm may by no means come in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with much the Plurality, nor evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Authority of thoſe, who being infinitely more in number, and upon the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100786:32"/>
moſt certain Demonſtrations have evinc'd the contrary.</p>
            <p>Upon this Conſideration 'tis that all Publick Changes and Alterations of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though attended with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and fatal Calamities, are manag'd by Providence, for as much as God propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Ends of Good; either Firſt, By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Puniſhments for Sin; or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, uſing them as means to draw Mens Affections from Temporal Things: Or Laſtly, by propounding ſome other ſecret ways for the declaration of his own Glory. But whatſoever Motive there be on God's Part, certain 'tis, that their Effects iſſue from a Combination of Natural Cauſes, and do proceed either from the Ignorance of Counſellors, from the Corruption of Officers, from Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at home, and from Confederacies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; all which, and many ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, are the ordinary Symptoms of a declining State. Nevertheleſs, there are Eyes too in this Wheel of Fortune, which like that of a Watch, has its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion viſible to all, whilſt the Spring by which it moves lies unſeen.</p>
            <p>And yet it cannot be deny'd, but that Providence by ſome extraordinary Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and in a way Supernatural, does ſometimes manifeſt it ſelf; and of this we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100786:32"/>
have Examples in prophane Story. The <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> were not ignorant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; who when their Army was deſtroy'd by Peſtilence, ſent <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> with Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and deſir'd <hi>Chryſes</hi> to intercede for them with <hi>Apollo: Diodorus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Diod. lib. 17. Hiſt.</note> 
               <hi>Siculus</hi> makes it out, that the Prodigious Earthquakes and Inundations in <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> in the Fourth year of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> were caus'd by the Gods, for the Puniſhment of Mens Impieties. The change of Temporal Succeſs and Fortune is many times ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and ſo much againſt the Stream and Current of preſent Opportunities, that we muſt confeſs there is an over-ruling Providence, that does blaſt the Purpoſes and preſent Advantages of Men; witneſs <hi>Imillo</hi> General of the <hi>Carthagenian</hi> Army, <note place="margin">Diodorus lib. 14.

I confeſs, we do not every where meet with Inſtances of this Nature; but yet we may obſerve in the Courſe of Providence ſome unexpected Iſſues, by which the meaneſt Inſtruments, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greateſt diſadvantages, are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by they know not what kind of <hi>Impetus</hi> to the compaſſing of great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; whilſt others upon the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of preſent Means, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of paſt Succeſs, are dampt in the Execution, and in the very heat of things find a qualm. Such Accidents, or ſeeming Irregularities, are by moſt aſcrib'd to Fortune, to they know not what confluence of lucky Circumſtances, when yet they ſeem to be the greateſt Proofs of a ſuperlative Energy and Wiſdom, to be able to produce ſuch ſtrange Effects out of ſo obſcure and ſmall Beginnings; like what we obſerve in the Mathematicks, where the Wiſdom of the firſt Inventor is ſeen from hence, that from a few ordinary and common Principles, and obvious to the meaneſt Capacities, are rais'd ſuch mighty Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems, as raviſh the moſt Maſculine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings in the Contemplation of them: And as in theſe, ſo alſo in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100786:33"/>
progreſs of Providential Diſpenſations, though they ſeem abſtruſe at firſt, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have dwelt a little on them, we ſee the reliance of ſuch Conſequences upon their Antecedents in the Connexion, which runs through the whole Choire of Cauſes. It is not uſual with God in his Providential Regimen, to unhinge Secondary and Natural Cauſes each from other: No, he does from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity foreſee Events, and muſt therefore penetrate the moſt retired Thoughts, and preſide over the moſt retir'd and deepeſt Conſultations; which though they be of Evil Conſequence to us, as being execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by wicked Inſtruments, yet to him who ſits above, they are deſign'd as Chaſtiſements for paſt, and Terrours for future Provocations, and are the Effects therefore not only of his Juſtice, but of his Mercy alſo.</p>
            <p>For our fuller underſtanding this Point, there is one difficulty which ſeems to obſtruct our progreſs in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and 'tis this: If Alterations and Revolutions of Government be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by the diſpoſition of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, then is it not a Sin to comply with God in ſuch his Purpoſes? Nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are oblig'd thereto, ſince 'tis the Duty of every Man to endeavour
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100786:34"/>
the accompliſhment of that by which God deſigns his own Glory. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been the Pillar of Rebellion, the Divine Palladium, or rather the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, from whence came the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Ruine almoſt of this Kingdom. In the ſolution whereof I ſhall obſerve Three Degrees of Divine Providence: The Firſt is that, by which God, as the Creator and Preſerver of the Univerſe, concurs indifferently to the Actions of his Creatures: The Second is that, by which he does ſo diſpoſe of Accidents, and in a Natural way, as to make them uſeful to the Purpoſes of Men, which yet could never have been foreſeen by any human Sagacity: What is more uncertain than the Weather, yet what Succeſs has follow'd in point of War, when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, upon the Inconveniencies of Rain, has found the Progreſs of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune bounded by the Inundations of a River, or by the Diſeaſes caus'd by too immoderate wet in the continuance of a Siege. The Third and Laſt Degree of Providence is that, when by ſome Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and Miraculous way, a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is declar'd from Heaven againſt the Proceedings of Men; now to apply theſe Caſes to our preſent Purpoſe. As for the Laſt, Men without controverſie are not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100786:34"/>
concern'd herein, ſuch Effects being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to proceed in a way Supernatural, and from the immediate Hand of God; or if their Concurrence were requir'd, they might act their Parts ſecurely no doubt, it being impoſſible for God to work a Miracle for the compaſſing of a ſinful Action: But this cannot concern the Objection, becauſe we ſee no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms now deſtroy'd by Miracles: Nor is the Firſt Caſe of moment, becauſe God does no more than what the Exigencies of Finite Creatures, require of him as their Creator; that is, his ordinary Concurrence with them ſo far, as they depend upon him in all their Actions, whether Good or Evil; and therefore the Rebel has no better a Plea for the Succeſs he meets with than the Murderer, ſince God affords his ordinary and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concurrence indifferently to both. The ſtreſs then of ſuch Pretences muſt lie upon the Second Method, <hi>viz.</hi> When by an immediate Contribution of Natural Cauſes, God ſhews himſelf more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to one ſide than the other; but this can be no good Argument, unleſs I knew that there were an immediate and ſpecial Influence of God therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. Secondly, admitting this were known, yet unleſs we knew the Mind of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100786:35"/>
God, and ſo propoſe the ſame End, we can have no aſſurance that what we do is Juſt, ſince the ſame Action, according to the ſeveral Ends propos'd, becomes qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with different Formalities of Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew the Abſurdity of thoſe who maintain God's Secret Will in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his Reveal'd; and according to our Modern Language, own God as King, <hi>i. e.</hi> fight againſt him in one Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to preſerve him in another: I ſhall obſerve firſt; That Politick Power in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is immediately from God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded upon the Law of Nature: For whether Men will or no, they muſt be Govern'd ſome way; ſince, to the Conſervation of human Race, 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that men ſhould be ſecure from the violence of Oppreſſors; but no man can be ſecure, but by flying to ſome Body who is Superiour to him who offers Violence; and Superiour he muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtrength of Arms or by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Should private Queſtions and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels be decided by Strength, the World would quickly fall to Pieces; it remains therefore, that Recourſe muſt be had to one who is Supream in point of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Command. In the next Place, 'tis indiſputable, that this or that kind
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100786:35"/>
of Government <hi>in Specie,</hi> whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Ariſtocracy, or the like, is not <hi>De jure Naturae,</hi> and from God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; but by the conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple intervening: For by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no Man has Right to rule more than another: but when Men for their own private Quiet and Security do diveſt themſelves of that Power, by conferring it on a common Repreſentative: Or when Kingdoms got by Uſurpation, in tract of time become Lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Concurrence of the People being won over by degrees. In theſe Caſes, ſo far as they reſign their Power, ſo far have they made themſelves Subjects: and therefore if an Uſurper acquire the Power <hi>de facto,</hi> this cannot be ſaid to be from God, ſince the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is <hi>de Jure Naturae,</hi> cannot be reſum'd and transferr'd upon any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Capacity, as long as that's in being on which they conferr'd their Right at firſt.</p>

            <p>AND here I muſt beg my Readers leave to digreſs a little from the Method I propos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to meddle with Arguments of Sacred Authority, till ſuch time as by the Thread of this Diſcourſe I ſhould be brought to ſpeak of reveal'd Religion, and particularly the Chriſtian<hi>:</hi> But ſo it is, that I cannot make any further Progreſs, till ſuch time as ſome Difficulties be remov'd, which ſeem to obviate our intended Method, under an appearance of being founded (or to ſpeak more properly confounded) in God's Providential Order. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall look back a little upon the Government of the late Uſurper, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but meet with many pretended Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, I ſhould ſay Incendiaries, of thoſe times, who endeavour'd to father the Revolution upon God's ſingular and gracious Providence; and ſo making it to be of Divine Authority. And becauſe ſuch Revolutions may happen again, it will not be amiſs to examine this Doctrine by the Weights and Meaſures of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: and that we may do this, it will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100786:36"/>
be proper to enquire a little (as far as our ſhallow Reaſon will permit) into the manner of God's Operations in the Minds, and with the Actions of Men.</p>
            <p>That we may underſtand the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore aright, I ſhall premiſe Two Things: Firſt, That I ſhall not in this place diſcourſe of Evangelical Works or Graces, but of Moral Duties; nor yet of ſuch as are morally good, but of ſuch rather as are morally bad, and of the Cauſes from whence they riſe. In the next place, that in regard to Human Actions, the efficient Cauſes are of Two ſorts: Firſt, Phyſical, or ſuch by which the ſubſtance or matter of the Action (as I may ſay with leave from Logick) is produc'd. There is alſo another kind of efficient Cauſe, and that is Moral; as where one invites another to an Action by propoſing a Reward; or by counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or exciting his Will and Affections to make ſuch a Choice: Alſo the final Cauſe, (which is term'd by ſome the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective) comes under this denomination; foraſmuch as the End or Object in all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Human Actions, does influence the Action, and excite, move, and by a kind of ſecret force impell him to act for the obtaining of ſuch an End or Object.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100786:37"/>
Now for the Phyſical Influence of God on Human Actions, it is no way to be doubted that he concurs to them; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as being the Creator of all things, they cannot act without him: but this kind of influence is general, and regards all Human Actions, not as good or bad, but purely as the Actions of his Creatures; like the influence of the Sun which indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently ſhines upon the Earth, and ſerves to nouriſh and to mature hurtful as well as wholſome Plants. The ſtreſs then of the Queſtion is converſant about a moral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, as whether God does excite the Will and Affections to ſinful Actions by impelling them thereunto, by propoſing undue Objects, or by obſtructing them from making any other choice.</p>
            <p>The Great Doctor and Divine of his time, and who drew great numbers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>John Calvin,</hi> ſeems to have laid the Foundation of thoſe many Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions touching Providence, in ſome bold and Heterodox Aſſertions of God's being the Author and firſt Mover of Man to all ſinful Actions; denying him not only a liberty of doing good, but of declining Evil; ſo that whatſoever Sin any man commits, does not proceed from the man's own free Choice, (for then he might have declin'd it,) but from a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100786:37"/>
in God, who does actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite him to the commiſſion of it. This he profeſſedly and ſtrenuouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in teaching, <hi>That Men do nothing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Calv lib. 1. Inſtitut. c. 18. Sect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>but by the ſecret Approbation of God: nor act any thing with deliberation, but what he himſelf hath before decreed, and by his ſecret Direction hath conſtituted, as is fully proved by innumberable and clear Teſtimonies:</hi> And a little before he ſaith, <hi>It may ſeem abſurd perhaps, that by the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God a Man ſhould be made blind; for which blindneſs he afterwards ſuffers puniſhment: this they endeavour to evade, by ſaying, That is done by the Permiſſion, not by the Will of God; but whilſt God declares openly, that he himſelf does it, this Evaſion is baffled.</hi> Likewiſe ſpeaking of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> whom God made uſe of for the Chaſtiſement of <hi>Judah,</hi> he ſays, <hi>They were impell'd by the Will and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God: I confeſs</hi> (ſays he) <note place="margin">Ibid. Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>God, many times acts in the Reprobate, by making uſe alſo of Satan's Labour; but yet ſo far only as 'tis permitted to Satan to move in it by the impulſe of God!</hi> O ſtrange! we had thought that Satan had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough of himſelf to tempt us to Sin, and that he needed not to be puſhed on to it by God! But to proceed; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts Satan from being any other than
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100786:38"/>
the Tool or Inſtrument which God makes uſe of to effect wicked purpoſes. It is ſaid, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.) continueth <hi>Calvin, That Satan,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Inſt. cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>or the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of thoſe who believe not: but how can this be, unleſs the efficacy of the Error proceed from God?</hi> And in this Senſe 'tis that <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds that place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>That the Efficacy of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Inſt. cap. 18. Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>or of being ſeduc'd, was infus'd by God, to the end that they might believe a Lye, who obeyed not the truth:</hi> And in this Senſe alſo 'tis that he explains that Paſſage of the Fourteenth of <hi>Ezekiel; And if a Prophet be deceiv'd when he hath ſpoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Examples, he produces that of <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing <hi>David;</hi> of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Father's Concubines; of the lying Spirit which deceiv'd the Prophets, and by them <hi>Ahab,</hi> to the end he might periſh at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead;</hi> of Satan's miſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Job,</hi> with many other Paſſages of the like Nature; all which he pretends to have proceeded effectually from God; and that the Devil was only the Inſtrument, as was ſaid before, to execute what God had commanded. And to prevent that Anſwer which Divines commonly make to ſuch Objections, <hi>viz.</hi> That God may be ſaid to harden the Hearts of Men,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100786:38"/>
and to infatuate and darken their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and Minds, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Spirit and Grace, and to leave Men to their natural blindneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: This he rejects as unſound, ſtanding ſtiffly to his Doctrine, to wit, <hi>That God, by the help of Satan, does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Inſt. Cap. 4. Sect. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the Counſels of wicked Men as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and that he does excite their Wills, and confirm and ſtrengthen them in their Purpoſes.</hi> And for thoſe who are of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Opinion, he looks upon them as Blaſphemers, who ſpit their Venom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heaven; adding withal, that this is no new thing, ſince in all Ages there have been wicked and prophane Men, <hi>Qui adverſus hanc Doctrinae partem ore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bido</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Inſt. Cap. 18. Sect. ult.</note> 
               <hi>latrarent;</hi> which Language of his is ſo virulent and unchriſtian like, that I know not how to make it <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And to conclude this Chapter, ſays <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> If it ſhall ſeem difficult to any what we now aſſert, to wit, That there is no Agreement of God with Man, when Man by the juſt <hi>Impulſe of God does that which is not lawful for him to do,</hi> he cryes out: <hi>Who can forbear trembling at the Judgments of God, who works in the Hearts of Men whatſoever he will!</hi> More juſtly may we cry out, Who can forbear trembling to hear ſuch deſperate Doctrine! 'Tis true, he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100786:39"/>
denies every where that God is the cauſe of Sin; but whether that which I have cited out of him, and which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him, not occaſionally, but <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> be not a proof of his making God to be the cauſe of Sin, I know not what can ever be proved upon the Earth; and if he contradicts himſelf, let thoſe who follow him look to that; he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Particular to be an Example of that Judgment which he ſo often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to God, of being deliver'd over in <hi>Reprobum ſenſum,</hi> or of having the Eyes of his Underſtanding darkned.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom I ſhall forbear to treat with that ſcurrilous Language he ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtows on thoſe who differ from him in Opinion upon this Point. He was certainly a learned Man, and of a ſtrict Life, and ſevere; but withal of a moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and ſour Diſpoſition; moſt vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, furious, and obſtinate, (as are all thoſe who follow him) moſt opiniative of himſelf; a Vilifier of ſuch as deſerted from him; and as to what concerns the Point in queſtion, his Doctrine is little leſs than Blaſphemy: For according to this Doctrine, Man is made a meer ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, dead, and Paſſive Principle: and Free Grace is built upon the greateſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100786:39"/>
of which a Rational Nature is capable, (if ſo be it be capable thereof,) a neceſſity to Sin.</p>
            <p>But God has given us faculties to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate betwixt Good and Evil, and Abilities alſo to arbitrate upon them: To what purpoſe otherwiſe are all thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, Exhortations, and Prohibitions, ſo frequently us'd and inſiſted on in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What meaneth the Spirit of God when we are required <hi>to do good, and eſchew evil; to repent us of our ſinful ways, and to turn unto the Lord; to put on the Armour of God, and to withſtand the Wiles of the Devil, and to work out our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling?</hi> For if ſo be I have not a power to obey theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, How is it that God commands me to do that which is impoſſible, and yet puniſhes the non-performance with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death? This is all one, as if a General ſhould bind his Soldiers Hands and Feet, and having done ſo, require him to riſe up, to apply himſelf to his Service, and to combat the Enemy, and then execute the man for not executing his Commands. Beſides, ſuppoſing the Will to be thus impotent and deprav'd, might not the Sinner thus interrogate his Soul; Why am I thus ſollicitous to withſtand the Aſſaults of the Devil? Why do I thus
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100786:40"/>
tire and weary out my ſelf with vain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours? Why do I embitter the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Enjoyments of my Life with Grief and Anxiety, when it lies not in my own power to remove my Fear? Nay, might not the Reprobate thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with God, as <hi>Soſtratus</hi> in <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> did with <hi>Minos;</hi> Seeſt thou not with what Injuſtice thou art chargeable, who haſt doom'd me to everlaſting Miſery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſervient and inſtrumental only in thoſe Evils which Fate had predefin'd; and yet thou rewardeſt others with Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, who are no other than the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of that Good, to which the guidance of their unalterable Decrees had pre-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd them? Was there not the ſame Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in both? why then is there ſuch inequality in the Sentence? Theſe and ſuch like prodigious Blaſphemies are the Natural, or rather the Unnatural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>'Tis true; if we look back on man, as in a ſtate of Nature, and as under the deprivation of that Primitive Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with which he was once inveſted, he has no Abilities of himſelf to fulfil the Will of God, nor perform thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duties which are requir'd of him, unleſs he be firſt illuminated by God's Holy Spirit, quicken'd with his Grace,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100786:40"/>
and encouraged by the diſcoveries and Gracious promiſes of the Goſpel: But this is nothing to the Queſtion, for we now conſider man under his moral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; and of moral Actions 'tis that <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us, That it is of the ſpecial Grace of God as often as we think of doing any thing which may concern our Temporal Good; or as often as our minds and thoughts have a verſion to any thing that may hurt us: Upon theſe moral Actions then it is that <hi>Calvin</hi> does chiefly controvert; though the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Examples he makes uſe of, are taken in a manner all of them from the Old Teſtament<hi>:</hi> To all which I anſwer:</p>
            <p>Firſt, in general, That thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which we meet with every where in Scripture, are not to be underſtood in ſtrict Propriety of Language; but <hi>per Modum Recipientis,</hi> and in the ſame Senſe as God is ſaid every where to repent, to be jealous, to be angry, to forget, to hear and ſee, with ſuch like Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Affections as are infinitely ſhort of the Divine Nature; it ſeeming good to the Holy Spirit to uſe ſuch Deſcriptions to make weak and ignorant men more capable to underſtand the Will of God by ſuch ſenſible and familiar Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100786:41"/>
And that this is the true Senſe of them is evident, from thoſe infinite Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Old Teſtament, where Men are invited to Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life, to turn to the Lord, and where heavy Judgments are every where denounc'd againſt thoſe who ſhall not conform themſelves to ſuch Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all which would be nothing but a mere deluſion of men, if they were not able to turn themſelves one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis certain alſo, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets every where uſe many Rhetorical and Figurative Expreſſions, Emblems and Similitudes, as doth <hi>David</hi> alſo, <hi>Job,</hi> and almoſt all the Ancient Writers: Now to underſtand all theſe literally, would be to lead us into endleſs Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; we have therefore no other Rule to underſtand them by, but by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in ſuch a Senſe, as ſhall agree beſt with the Nature and Attributes of God, with the general Context and Scope of Scripture, and with the Nature alſo of Men endu'd with Reaſonable Souls.</p>
            <p>Now ſo it is, that the Actions of Men are aſcrib'd alſo to God, not only from that general Influence he has upon his Creatures as their Creator, and by which he gives them Beings, and affords them his general Concurrence in all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100786:41"/>
whether Good or Evil (it being impoſſible a Creature ſhould ſubſiſt a moment independant upon God) but more eſpecially ſuch Actions are aſcrib'd to him, by reaſon of his foreknowledge of all future Events from all Eternity: And for as much as by his Previdence or Providence, he ſo orders theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Actions, as to make them beneficial to Men, and declaratory of his own Glory; either by uſing them as Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to humble them under the ſenſe of their Failings, or to divorce them from their Paſſionate Deſires after worldly Comforts; all which ſhews great Power as well as Goodneſs, proper only to Almighty God, to produce ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Effects out of Evil, and to make an Antidote out of the Poiſon of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>This may more ſpecially be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all the Inſtances which <hi>Calvin</hi> does enlarge upon, in making God to work inwardly in the Minds of Men, and as it were to inſpire them with wicked Purpoſes. Firſt then, for <hi>Shimei</hi>'s cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>David,</hi> it was a Tranſgreſſion againſt the Fifth Commandment of the Moral Law. <hi>David,</hi> who dated his Miſeries from the time of his Sin againſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> reflecting upon God's Juſt Judgments on

him in a continual ſeries of Afflictions, commencing from that fatal Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, piouſly aſcribes this particular Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Shimei</hi> to God's Juſt Judgment; for had he been aſcertain'd that God had directed or inſpir'd <hi>Shemei</hi> to it, it had been very unjuſt in <hi>David,</hi> upon his Death-bed, to mind <hi>Solomon</hi> of taking Revenge on <hi>Shimei,</hi> for what was done many years before by God's ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Next for <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s lying with his Father's Concubines; this was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by <hi>David</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion of the Seventh Commandment, for which God tells him (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.) that he would raiſe up Evil againſt him out of his own Houſe, and that his Neighbour ſhould lie with his Wives in the ſight of the Sun; which was verified in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who tranſgreſſing the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as alſo the Seventh, executed what God had foretold, by ſpreading upon the Terraſs of the Royal Palace, and there lying with his Father's Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines in the ſight of all <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This execrable Fact is ſaid to be done by God's Appointment, for as much as he made uſe of it for the Puniſhment of <hi>David</hi> by a way of Retaliation; when yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Counſellor of this wicked ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was the Devil, or <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100786:42"/>
by this means thought to make the Breach betwixt the Father and the Son to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance is that of <hi>Job</hi>'s Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but this was not <hi>Malum Culpae,</hi> but <hi>Malum Poenae,</hi> deſign'd by God for the tryal of <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience, and for the Procurement of greater Bleſſings; and executed by the Devil with deſign to drive <hi>Job</hi> to Deſperation; in which Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage we find, that God's Part was only permiſſive, in withdrawing that Vertue, by which the Devil was kept in Awe and Subjection. Another Example is that of the Prophet, who ſeduc'd <hi>Ahab</hi> to go up and fall at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.) This was ſaid alſo to be from the Lord, foraſmuch as he ſuffer'd a Spirit or the Devil, to inſpire the Prophets with a Lye. This fatal End was juſtly due to <hi>Ahab,</hi> who himſelf all his Life time had been willingly ſeduc'd by falſe Prophets, and was guilty alſo of ſhedding the Blood of Innocent <hi>Naboth.</hi> Nor does it appear, that what was reported by <hi>Micaiah</hi> in this Matter, was any more than Viſionary, repreſenting God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould periſh by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, who whilſt he liv'd was the great Patron or Protector of them: For to underſtand it literally, that God did hold
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100786:43"/>
ſuch a Conſult, and ask Advice of Evil Spirits how to deſtroy <hi>Ahab,</hi> is what we cannot apprehend, but under ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and Characters of Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as are utterly inconſiſtent with the Nature of God.</p>
            <p>In like manner ought we to interpret that Place in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> of God's ſaying, that when a Prophet is deceiv'd, 'tis he that deceiveth him; as likewiſe that other Paſſage of 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. all which cannot be underſtood otherwiſe than of God's withdrawing his Grace, and ſo leave Men to the Courſe of their own Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Luſts and Paſſions, and to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the Devil. And here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but call to remembrance how Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſuch Expreſſions were abus'd in the Time of the late Uſurper: For ſome of his Chaplains, as they call'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, pretending to have a Revelation from Heaven of his Recovery, when the Cheat was confuted by his ſubſequent Death, one of them in a Strain of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, charg'd God in the Language of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> crying out, <hi>Lord thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd us, nay even thou haſt ly'd unto us.</hi> To ſuch dreadful Blaſphemies are Men miſled by ſuch groſs and perverſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100786:43"/>
The laſt Argument of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s which I ſhall mention, is that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cap. 6. Where God bids the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Make the Heart of the people fat, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen their Ears, and blind their Eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, hear with their Ears, and underſtand with their Hearts, and be converted and live.</hi> This Paſſage <hi>Calvin</hi> much triumphs in, making frequent uſe of it to prove, That Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Infatuation is the work of God. Now if this be underſtood literally, it proves that God does uſe his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſeduce and deſtroy thoſe, who otherwiſe would turn to him by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; a thing which cannot be thought of but with great Impiety. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it proves the contrary to that for which <hi>Calvin</hi> does alledge it; for <hi>Calvin</hi> labours to prove from hence, that Man has not a power to decline a ſinful Act, when yet the Words import the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For were it not for ſuch a Spiritual Infatuation and Blindneſs, Men happily might ſee and underſtand too, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; ſo that they are blinded on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prevent their Converſion by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And if they were blind before, what needs a direction to make them blind: This would be the ſame thing, as if we ſhould take one who was born without
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100786:44"/>
Eyes, and ſhut him up in a dark cloſe Dungeon, for fear he ſhould ſee and make an eſcape; or as if we ſhould load a Cripple with Irons, for fear he ſhould make uſe of his Legs and run away; ſo that the very manner we ſee of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets expreſſing himſelf, does imply a power in the Sinner of making uſe of his Eyes and Underſtanding in order to his own Converſion. All that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded then from this place is this, That God may in Juſtice deprive Men of, or withdraw thoſe Natural Gifts from wicked Men, who have for a long time withſtood the good Motions of God's Holy Spirit inviting them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which the Prophet does expreſs Symbolically, by deafning and blinding.</p>
            <p>That we may not expatiate in <hi>infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> upon this Topick, we will take in one Inſtance more out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which <hi>Calvin</hi> ſo much relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which carries indeed the greateſt ſhew of difficulty, being that of <hi>Acts</hi> the 2. where St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, that Chriſt was deliver'd up by the determinate Counſel and fore-knowledge of God; for as much as God by his infinite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Goodneſs, made it a Means of conveying the greateſt happineſs to Mankind, in the Redemption of it, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100786:44"/>
the Paſſion of his only Son; when yet we find, that the True Moral Cauſe, or Incentive to this wickedneſs of the Jews, was the Devil, who entring into <hi>Judas,</hi> made uſe of his Covetous Diſpoſition, and for the lucre of a little Money tempted him to betray his Maſter.</p>
            <p>We ſee then, that God, though he does not excite and impel the Wills of Men to ſinful Actions, yet is he not an idle Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of them, as <hi>Calvin</hi> dreams would follow from hence: For we ſee God acts a Part, and a great Part in them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Concurrence to them, as a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, but in making uſe of them; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Evil Inclinations of men for good Ends, extracting Medicines out of Poiſon, which indeed is the greateſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs. And that a Rational Creature ſhould have ſuch a Power from his Creator over its own Actions, as to follow the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Tendency of its own Faculties, is yet a further Proof of the Power and Wiſdom of his Creator; as 'tis a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proof doubtleſs of the Will and Abilities of a Work-man, to be able to make a Watch which ſhall move orderly by Virtue of thoſe Retorts and Springs he gave it, when he firſt made it, than if the Hand of the Artificer were always
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100786:45"/>
upon the Needle, to direct and govern it in its motions. It is the Will of God, that Sinners ſhould repent and be ſav'd; and for this End he ſent his Son to take our Nature upon him: What Evil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fall into is from our ſelves, and reflects not at all on God. The Sun (that Glorious Creature, and the great Inſtrument by which God governs the Vegetative World, and in a manner the Senſitive) does contribute to the Life and Growth of all Plants indifferently; and that ſome are poiſonous and hurtful, proceeds not from the Sun, but from the Nature of the Herb; and if the Sun by its atractive Beams, does raiſe Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Smells and Vapours which infect the Air, and cauſe Diſeaſes, this does not argue the leaſt malignity in that bright Planet, nor is the miſchief to be aſcrib'd to it, but to the Lakes, Ditches, and Dung-hills from whence they riſe.</p>
            <p>And thus have I endeavour'd to give ſuch an Explication of God's Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with men, as is freeſt from Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which is ſuitable to the Power, ſuitable to the Wiſdom, ſuitable to the Goodneſs, and ſuitable to the Juſtice of God; whereas the contrary Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not only repugnant to all theſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100786:45"/>
but fills the Mind with infinite Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and leads its Adherors into fatal Errors.</p>

            </head>
            <p>HAving ſpoken to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Doctrine, touching God's Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Men in ſinful Actions, the next thing to be Diſcours'd of, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Vindication of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from falſe Imputations, is that great and popular Point, Of his Influence on Publick and National Alterations: This being no other than a Superſtructure upon the former Doctrine. Now the Queſtion is not about ſubmiſſion to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which <hi>de facto</hi> is over us, but to inquire, whether all ſuch Alterations, though brought about or begun by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Rebellions, Uſurpations, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Perjury, ſlanderous Aſperſions and Defamations, Pious Frauds, and perhaps Conqueſt, be of God's appointment, or of a Divine Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100786:46"/>
The Arguments which are brought to prove them ſuch, are taken partly from Example, partly from Precepts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though ill expounded and worſe apply'd; of which the firſt is that of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Revolt or Rebellion againſt <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> which is ſaid to be of the Lord, who alſo ſent a Prophet with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commiſſion to Annoint him. To this I have already ſpoken, at preſent 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſay, That the Evil of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was denounc'd and executed by God againſt the Houſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> for their Idolatry, upon his permiſſion of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Sin of Rebellion; the Houſe alſo of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> being puniſh'd in like manner, by the Rebellion of <hi>Baaſha,</hi> for the like Idolatry; as <hi>Baaſha</hi> was puniſh'd for his Idolatry alſo, by other Rebellions, and ſo on to the Reign of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who was chaſtis'd by <hi>Jehu;</hi> who himſelf, though ſaid to be appointed by God hereunto was no better than the reſt, till at length the Ten Tribes, with their Kings and Government, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſubverted in a final Captivity. Whatſoever then may be inferr'd from hence, this is certain, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in adhering to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> are branded deeply with Rebellion by the Spirit of God; and 'tis probable too,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100786:46"/>
that they had never fallen into that groſs Idolatry or Rebellion againſt God, had they not at firſt fallen from their Civil Duty and Allegiance to their King; for we find that the Golden Calves were ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to this End, leſt the People going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Place of the true Worſhip, might have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee their Sin, by ſerving the True God, which probably muſt have begot deſires in them to ſhake off that Yoke which Uſurpation had laid upon them.</p>
            <p>The whole Order and Method of God's Providential Influence in ſuch like Caſes, may be read more viſibly in that Rebellion, or ſhort Revolution under King <hi>David,</hi> who for that hardly to be expiated Sin againſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> mov'd God to bring his Judgments upon him, and amongſt the reſt this was one, <hi>viz.</hi> To raiſe him Evil from his own Houſe and Loins: For this is aſcrib'd to God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and ſo deeply was King <hi>David</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſenſe hereof, that when he heard of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Conſpiracy, like a man deſtitute of help, and abandon'd by God (though he were known at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times to have been a Soldier of an undaunted Valour) he quitted the Royal City in a moſt dejected manner, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſmall Troop, marching in a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100786:47"/>
Penitential Order or Proceſſion, and not like an offended Soveraign; ſo that his abject Behaviour drew Tears from all the Spectators, excepting <hi>Shimei,</hi> who doubtleſs was the Head of a raſcally Mob, to inſult upon injur'd Majeſty, pelting him with Stones and Curſes: Nay, this Man after God's own Heart, was brought to ſo low an Ebb, that his Prophetick Spirit deſerted him, and left him expos'd to Terrours. And yet we find, that all theſe Calamities were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd by Human Means, and ſuch as we meet with uſually in Courts. His Son <hi>Abſalom</hi> we find was well enough qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to manage a Revolt; for of the two Rebellious Sons with which good King <hi>David</hi> was curs'd (for ſo it was, that he had two of them, <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah) Abſalom</hi> was much the more dangerous, not only as being ſupported by that Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a States-man <hi>Achitophel,</hi> but being himſelf alſo of a moſt plauſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating Behaviour, and aggravating al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the miſcarriages of the Court Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in that there was no Perſon of Integrity about the King to receive the Grievances of the People, and to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Juſtice; promiſing withal, that if he ever came to the Crown, he would redreſs ſuch Abuſes; holding alſo a more
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100786:47"/>
intimate Correſpondence with ſuch as were diſgrac'd and diſguſted with the Court; all which he receiv'd with great familiarity, embracing them in his Arms, and kiſſing them. By theſe Arts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity and Condeſcenſion, he is ſaid to have ſtoln, or rather raviſh'd the Hearts of <hi>David</hi>'s People. Such then were the Methods of former Times, as well as of later Ages, and ſuch they will be to the end of the World. And as theſe were human Policies, ſo were they blown up too by the like human Artifice: For <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Archite,</hi> a ſure Friend of <hi>David</hi>'s, claps on a Mask for a time, and gets within King <hi>Abſalom,</hi> by crying, <hi>God ſave the King, God ſave the King!</hi> And when <hi>Abſalom</hi> in a ſurly manner rallied him for abandoning his Soveraign Lord and Maſter, <hi>Huſhai</hi> with a <hi>Gentel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe non pareille,</hi> with an unparallell'd ſoftneſs, and with the utmoſt Artifice of a double refin'd Courtier, cajol'd <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> in making God's Providence and the Conſent of the People, to be the ground and meaſure of his Allegiance, ſaying, <hi>Nay, but whom the Lord and this People, and all the men of Iſrael chooſe, his will I be, and with him will I abide,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. And then ſubjoins; <hi>whom ſhould I ſerve, ſhould I not ſerve in the</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100786:48"/>
               <hi>preſence of his Son? as I have ſerv'd in thy Father's preſence, ſo will I ſerve in thy preſence:</hi> For which ſeaſonable and well manag'd Piece of Flattery or Court Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he was admitted into the Number of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Privy Councellors, and by that means did diſcover and defeat <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Advice, which drew on the Reſtauration of his old Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
            <p>Nay, though God in theſe or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, had declar'd his Will in the moſt ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imaginable concerning ſuch Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that they were brought to paſs by him of his deliberate Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Inſtitution, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as any other Poſitive Law whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet is not this any good Argument to prove ſuch Alterations in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be <hi>de jure divino.</hi> For the Jewiſh Government was a Theocracy or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment where God did viſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, raiſing up Judges, Deliverers, and Prophets by his ſpecial Inſpiration from time to time, even from the Children of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> leaving <hi>Egypt</hi> to the days of <hi>Samuel:</hi> Then indeed it was, that the People deſiring to be like the reſt of the Nations round about them, Petition'd for a King; which ſhews, though it were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100786:48"/>
not according to God's Counſel and Good-liking, as God himſelf teſtified ſaying, that in asking for a King they did reject him from being their King; yet ſo it was, that God hearkned to them, where by the way we may obſerve how God acted in this Alteration of the Jewiſh Government, conformably to the Wills and previous Inclinations of the People, naming the Perſon to them whom he caus'd to be Anointed; ſo that 'twas not here, as 'twas in other Kingdoms, which were Elective or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary; for God Tranſlated the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> nor did <hi>Adonijah, David</hi>'s Elder Son ſucceed, but <hi>Solomon;</hi> the like Interruption of Deſcent we may obſerve in others alſo. And yet for all this, no Man doubts, but that in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms now adays the Hereditary Deſcent of the Crown in a right Line is very Conſonant to the Law of God; and he that ſhould produce the Examples of the Jewiſh Succeſſions to the contrary, would be lookt upon as a Mad-man. The Ordinary Method by which God now adays does govern theſe Affairs, is by the Civil Laws and Sanctions of a Kingdom, and the Suffrages of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not excluding the Law of Nature,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100786:49"/>
which gives Precedence to Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe Ordinances we are ſure do proceed from the God of Order; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever falls out otherwiſe muſt be lookt upon as extraordinary, and out of the common Road.</p>

And truly, by as good Authority may a Thief take away my Cattel. Put the Caſe then, that a Thief were Arraign'd for ſtealing, and Pleading not Guilty, the Court ſhould ask him, how he would be try'd? By the Word of God, ſays the Thief, (as <hi>H.

But <hi>Octavian</hi> and his Party, getting the better by many il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Methods, no leſs violent and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinous than thoſe of his Predeceſſors; the Form of the Government, I ſay, was chang'd, and ſubmitted to by the Senate themſelves, and thoſe brave Men who endeavour'd to preſerve and retrieve their Countries Liberty, were ſtigmatiz'd with the black Character of Conſpirators, and Parricides: So much does Succeſs give Credit and Authority to Tyrannical Attempts. Now where there is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Government of ſuch continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſo univerſally ſubmitted to by the former Lords and Maſters, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire was at the time St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, then will it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to cite this Paſſage: but when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this appears, an Argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a State ſo ſettled and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was, is little to the purpoſe. The ſame Anſwer ſerves to that place of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Ep. cap.</hi> 2. As alſo that of our Saviours paying Tribute, or giving to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that were <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s; for this was ſpoken
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100786:51"/>
about the Sixteenth Year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and Seventy Years after the death of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> ſo that in all theſe Caſes there was no viſible Right or Title which ſtood in competition with the Poſſeſſion of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture; in the Explication whereof the Rule is moſt ſafe and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, <hi>viz.</hi> to interpret Scripture by Scripture, and to underſtand it in ſuch a Senſe as ſhall not contradict a greater Evidence and Teſtimony of Scripture; and not to do as ſome, who when they are preſs'd with the pernicious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of their Interpretation, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhelter themſelves under God's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Wiſdom, crving out, <hi>Who art thou, O man, who preſcribeſt Rules to thy Maker!</hi> with ſuch Nonſenſical Stuff; as though God's Omnipotence could not be declared, but by obtruding on him horrid Impieties, and the moſt groſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities. By the ſame Capacity, or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity rather, by which they endeavour'd from Scripture Teſtimonies to prove National Revolutions, procur'd by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Means, to be the peculiar and proper Work of God's Providence; or that ſuch Tyrannical Powers, once introduc'd, have God's Authority to warrant, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100786:51"/>
defend them upon the Score of his Providential Prerogative: I ſay, by the ſame Logick we may prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo, that God has no Providential Care over the World at all: Foraſmuch as we read, 2 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>That the God of this World,</hi> viz. <hi>Satan, hath blinded the Minds of Men;</hi> ſo that the Dominion of Satan in his Government of this World is abſolute, and that of a God. Now if the Devil rules in this World as Prince, or God, what Province to aſſign to God Almighty's Inſpection, is hard to imagine.</p>
            <p>'Tis apparent therefore from hence, That all ſuch Scriptures are not to be underſtood literally, but analogically, and with reference to God's Attributes, and to the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith: Where, by the way, we may alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Calvin</hi>'s perverſe Interpretation of that place of 2 <hi>Theſ. chap.</hi> 2. where God is ſaid to ſend them a <hi>ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lye, that they all might be damn'd who believ'd not the Truth;</hi> when yet from this place of the ſecond to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 4. the blinding of the Minds of thoſe who believe not, is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Devil; to the Devil by the way of Counſel and Execution; to God by way of Permiſſion: For we cannot
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100786:52"/>
aſcribe this Spiritual Execution to God and Satan too in one and the ſame Senſe without manifeſt Impiety.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Temporal and greater Tranſactions of the World, what can be more abſurd, than that all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent acquiſitions, all the Uſurpations and Oppreſſions, all the Blood, Sacrilege, Rapine, and wicked Practices, by which many Kingdoms and Empires through all Ages have been raiſed up, propagated and enlarg'd; I ſay, that all ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms thus ſupported ſhould be God's Ordinances; and that they who do not acknowledge this, are in a State of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Hence it will follow, that all the Chriſtians who have groaned under the Turkiſh Slavery, ſhould they by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to Chriſtian Princes, endeavour to recover their former Fortunes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they were Tyrannically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of; in doing this they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Ordinances of God, and incur Damnation? Nay 'twill follow alſo that the power of Supremacy, which the Pope is ſaid to uſurp, is alſo of God, or God's Ordinance: And truly, if Duration can give a Title, this of the Pope's has been of longer continuance than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Title now in <hi>Europe,</hi> or perhaps in the whole World. It has been chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100786:52"/>
for above a Thouſand Years, and actually ſubmitted to by a great many Nations. But it may be ſaid perhaps, that the Popes Uſurpations are Spiritual, and that in Spiritual Matters we are to obey God rather than Man. This Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction does not diſſolve, but rather knit the Knot faſter: For the Text ſaith, <hi>There is no Power but of God; the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be are ordained of God;</hi> ſo that all Power, without exception falls under a Notion of God's Ordinance: And truly if God take ſuch a care for Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Adminiſtration, much more for Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; if a Sparrow falls not to the Ground without his Will, he muſt needs be morè concern'd for ſo great a Body of Men; the Church being that which he himſelf with his own Right Hand hath planted, in ſending his only Son to purchaſe it by his Incarnation, and ſuffering death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs. The Spiritual Capacity is his Kingdom more peculiarly; and tho' the Papal Power were an Uſurpation, that's no matter, it being once poſſeſs'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that for ſo long a time, it becomes a ſettled Government, and an Ordinance of God: They therefore who in the firſt Reformation did reſiſt this Power, did, according to theſe Mens Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, reſiſt the Ordinance of God, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100786:53"/>
are liable for ſo doing to Damnation. And thus have they found out a new Argument to juſtifie the Pope's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch as never any Jeſuit, nor the Pope himſelf yet dream'd of.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Dominion and Power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, according to their Doctrine, muſt be an Ordinance of God's alſo: For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope be Antichriſt, or whether he be yet to come, certain it is, his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is, or will be great: Nor could he have this Power, unleſs it were given him by God; they therefore who ſhall reſiſt Antichriſt, (according to this new Doctrine) reſiſt the Ordinance of God; and we know what follows, they ſhall receive Damnation; from which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as well as Doctrine, <hi>Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I firſt reflected upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> touching God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Influence, and the Conſequences of ſuch Doctrine, I was much amazed, that a Perſon of his Fame and Learning ſhould run upon ſuch a Precipice. But when I reflected upon <hi>Geneva</hi> alſo, and the Alterations he occaſion'd there by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, my wonder ceas'd: <hi>Geneva</hi> being the Meridian for which the Ominous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was calculated: hence it is, that whereſoever <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100786:53"/>
it makes deep Impreſſions, by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and caſting up Principalities and Powers. But whether it be that this Doctrine does diſpoſe Men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or that they who are diſpos'd to Rebellion, do embrace this Doctrine for a Convenience, is much the ſame thing; ſince in all places almoſt, where one has been introduc'd, or rather intruded, the other has ſat Regent. And truly, let Ambitious Perſons make what uſe they pleaſe of ſuch Doctrines, they will never reap the ſame Fruit from it in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation as they did in the Acquiſition of their Power; for 'tis but for a hot and freſh Purſuer, High-lander like, to leap up behind him, and unhorſe the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 'tis no matter how, and all is well; that one is tumbled out by another who jumps clearly into the Saddle; this feat of Activity is <hi>Opus Dei, the Lord's doing,</hi> and ſo let it be <hi>in Nomine Domini:</hi> though it be dreadful to conſider what fatal Calamities ſuch reiterated Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Viciſſitudes muſt introduce.</p>
            <p>Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, not only for the near Affinity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract which is betwixt it and the Devil, that Arch-Rebel, and for the myſtical Spells and Sacred Names it makes uſe of; but by reaſon alſo of its ſpecious Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100786:54"/>
by which, as a Sorcereſs, it chains and faſcinates all thoſe who look towards it. It fills their Mouths with nothing but Liberty, Property, Reformation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of corrupt Miniſters and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, miſapplying publick Money, and decay of Commerce; whilſt it fills their Hearts with the rich Spoils of the Publick, with hopes of new Titles and Honours; with private Revenge, with Plunder, with Indemnity, with Offices, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous promiſes of Succeſs, or of being advanc'd perhaps to the higheſt Pinacle of the Government. Theſe are the Philters by which Men are at firſt brought in, and at laſt caught: and when they come to die, like thoſe who have been long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted with the Deluſions of the Devil, they'll find that all thoſe ſplendid Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, all the Princely Company and Ornaments, all their Banquets, Jollity, and Flattering Delights, which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them amidſt their Conſults and Meetings of the Night, to vaniſh in an inſtant; and all the glorious Scenes of Darkneſs will prove in the end fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and meer Apparitions, when they themſelves, left naked and forlorn, ſhall be call'd upon, perhaps, to pay their laſt Debt, not only to Nature, but to the Law too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:100786:54"/>
I think, and frankly declare it, That if we look into the State of the World, we may ſafely ſay, that moſt, or all the Monarchies and Republicks in <hi>Europe,</hi> and elſewhere, for ought we know, derive their Birth (as I have ſaid before) from Uſurpation and Conqueſt; what Havock was made by the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Hunns, Normans,</hi> &amp;c. is legible in Hiſtory, and more legible in the Ruins and Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they made, we know what Kings are deſcended from them through all Ages: Nor can we of this Nation be ignorant, how the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> ſucceeded one another by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Extruſion: So that perhaps the poor <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Welſh,</hi> are the pureſt <hi>Abori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniſts</hi> this day in Chriſtendom. That therefore which made all theſe crude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, to digeſt and ripen into Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governments, was not an imaginary <hi>Jus Divinum;</hi> but time, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſent of the People, who by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Comport, and by mature and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Laws, gave that due mixture of theſe firſt jarring Inſtruments or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as made the Body, compounded of them, to be fix'd and ſolid. Good Laws then are thoſe eſſential and vital parts of Government, which carry the Image and Superſcription of Divine Authoriry.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100786:55"/>
Theſe are grounded upon Truth and right Reaſon, which without diſpute ſpring from God: The better therefore a Government is made up of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the better is its Conſtitution, and whatſoever Occaſions may introduce an Alteration, and whatſoever Diſaſters may attend it, it is Pious and Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to look up to Heaven, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Gods Clemency in the Chaſtiſement. And although God may, and does ſometimes, in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, and independent on ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Cauſes, to diſpoſe of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and give an Iſſue to them beyond the Proſpect of any Human view; yet unleſs we knew what and when 'twas, 'tis Arrogance in us, to ſtamp them all promiſcuouſly with the Image and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God: 'Tis enough for us to revere him, and humble our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his Providential Methods.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who endeavour to prove Monarchy to be <hi>ex Jure Naturae</hi> (and ſo by Antecedence <hi>ex Jure divino)</hi> from that Paternal Authority or Juriſdiction, which the Heads of Families or Tribes had over their own Members and Dependants in the firſt Ages of the World; this I ſay is no good Argument. I grant that the Heads or Fathers of every Tribe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100786:55"/>
had a Deſpotick and Supream Power over all who liv'd within their own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories: This then was the Order or Oeconomy of Mankind, for every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to make a Neighbourhood within it ſelf, and not to diſpoſe themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remoter Places, as now a-days. They endeavour'd alſo to encreaſe their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by the Number of Servants, who were alſo Incorporated into them. So that theſe Aſcititious or Adopted Members, were lookt upon as Branches grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Common Stock. This is evident from the Hiſtory of the Bible, where we read of Kings of every Town or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage almoſt, which were no more but Toparches or the Heads of ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which in Ancient Times were called Nations alſo. The like we may obſerve at this very day in the High-Lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which Country being never yet Conquer'd, or hardly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, they ſtill retain that Primaeval Oeconomy of uniting their Families into Bodies, which they call <hi>Clans,</hi> of which each has its Head, who has in a manner an abſolute Command over all the reſt of that Tribe or <hi>Clan,</hi> as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to all: This then, I ſay, was the Order and Government of the Ancient World in the Ages after the Flood: But
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100786:56"/>
being it was not poſſible that it ſhould continue in this State; for the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſo many Toparches or Princes of Families. Neighbouring one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, begat infinite Diſorders and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, which could not be terminated but by force of Arms: Something like this alſo we find at this day, to ariſe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt the High-land <hi>Clans,</hi> where meeting with one another in great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they fight it out at Sharps, and live always in a kind of Hoſtile manner. To remedy ſuch Miſchiefs, the ſeveral Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or Tribes of old, were forc'd to unite themſelves into one Common and greater Body, under certain Laws of Government, whether Monarchical or of a Commonwealth; or in Caſe of Conqueſt, to make the beſt Terms they could with the Conqueror. And this is the True and Natural Original of all Governments throughout the World, and are no more the Work and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, than other Civil or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Occurrences, derivable from him, as he is the Creator and Preſerver of the World, which generally he Governs by the ordinary and familiar Methods of Nature.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of God's ſpecial Providence over the Actions of Private Perſons.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FRom God's Providential Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Human Affairs, in reſpect of Civil Bodies, we advance in the next Place to conſider, the continuance of the ſame Paternal and Providential Power, in relation to the Lives and Actions of every Private Man: This follows Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the former, for as much as the ſame Virtue which moves the Body, muſt move alſo every Part and Member of it; as alſo, for that God's Omnipotence, Omniſcience, and Omnipreſence (upon which Attributes is founded his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Power) extend themſelves to all the Actions of Individual Perſons, from the dependance they have on him, as their firſt Cauſe and Preſerver. But to proſecute this Point with more particular Arguments, we may firſt take notice of what occurs to our Obſervation in God's ſpecial Care of Man, at his firſt entrance into the World, above other Creatures. It is known to all, how ſome have been expos'd in their Infancy, and have been
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100786:57"/>
miraculouſly preſerv'd to be the Parents of mighty Nations, ſuch as <hi>Moſes, Cyrus, Romulus;</hi> and the like is ſtoried alſo by the Poets, of their <hi>Jupiter</hi> and others of their Gods, thereby intimating the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of Divine Providence towards particular Men, not only in ſaving them from the Dangers they were expos'd to, but by making them the chiefeſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Matters of greateſt Moment and of Univerſal Benefit.</p>
            <p>But to leave theſe unuſual Methods, which ſeem to carry in them ſome ſhew of Miracle, let us look a little nearer home, and we ſhall find that Man, of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that come into the World, is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the moſt unable to ſhift for himſelf; all Beaſts, almoſt as ſoon as born, find the way to the Teat; Birds once hatch'd are quickly in a Condition to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but with Mankind 'tis otherwiſe. The Infant that is born ſtands in need of continual Help and Succour, and is expos'd to continual Cold and Hunger, to Wants and Danger; and this too, not for ſome days, but for ſome years, before it can be able to feed and nouriſh it ſelf; and yet we ſee how God does provide for all theſe Exigencies of Nature, when all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means ſeem to fail. For the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe poor Creatures, who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100786:57"/>
ſeem deſtitute of all Relief them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rarely miſcarry through want of Succour, unleſs through the wilful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Cruelty of ſuch Parents, who to conceal their own ſhame, or to eaſe themſelves of ſome ſmall Expence and Care, embrue their Hands in the Blood of thoſe tender Infants, or actually with-hold that Suſtenance and Comfort which their Condition does require: In which Caſe God is not oblig'd to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and force the Wills of thoſe bloody and obdurate Wretches, to prevent the Effects of their wicked Intentions, no more than he is oblig'd to lay a Phyſical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on Men to keep them from the commiſſion of Murder, Theft, Inceſt, or any other ſuch Crimes, as depend upon their own proper Will and Power.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here forbear to ſpeak of the Natural Gifts and Perfections of Man's Mind, (that being elſewhere treated of at large.) We have a ſignal Proof of God's particular Goodneſs and Care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, in that Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty he has given him over all other Animals whatſoever. How do all the Beaſts of the Earth and Fowls of the Air, give way and retire at his appearance or approach; and by ſuch with-drawing, confeſs a Majeſty in his Preſence? The
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100786:58"/>
fierceſt Creatures, and thoſe of greateſt ſtrength, will not make oppoſition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be mightily provok'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to great Extremity. Others again expreſs a more than ordinary Obſequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mixt with Fear, and almoſt all pay him Homage and Service. In a word, Providence is that Vigilant and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Mother, which with an hundred Arms labours perpetually, and preſents to every Man all the Bleſſings and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Nature. She enlivens him by the Light and Beauty of the Stars; ſhe warms him with her Flames; ſhe refreſhes him with her ſweet Showers and Breezes of Air; ſhe ſerves him with her whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Waters; ſhe ſurrounds him with Rivers, which ſerve for Defence and Commerce, for Delight and Benefit: She delights him with Verdant Paſtures, with enamel'd Meadows, and with the Curious Colours, Figures, and ſweet Odours of Herbs and Flowers. She does Recreate him with the Melody of Birds, and with the ſoft murmurs of Chryſtal Rivolets and Fountains; ſhe does nouriſh and enrich him with her fruitful Fields; ſhe ſhelters him with her Trees yielding Shade, and Materials for Building; ſhe does feaſt him with infinite variety of Fruits beautiful to the Eyes, fragrant to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100786:58"/>
the Smell, and delicious for Taſte, as well as wholeſom for Food; ſhe furniſhes his Table with all varieties of Meat, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens different Appetites, and the ſeveral Seaſons of Nature; the Earth with all ſorts of Fleſh, the Air with Fowl, and the Rivers with Fiſh; and in Caſe of Sickneſs, he is ſuccour'd with Medicinal Plants, Minerals, and Waters of rare Virtue; ſo that which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man turns himſelf, he receives Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from every quarter of the World, and Feaſts his Senſes with the Wonders and Delights which do ſurround him. Theſe indeed are but ſome of thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments which are in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Men, being ſuch as flow from the Hands of Providence in the Bleſſings of Nature; To which if we add the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Ornaments of Art, with what comes from Traffick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, they would exceed Number. As for other Creatures, into what a narrow compaſs are their Enjoyments reduc'd? All their content is meaſur'd by a little Food and Water; and after the Flux of a few years or days perhaps, they wax feeble and die.</p>
            <p>That which ſeems to diſcredit this important Truth, is the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which has been made through all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100786:59"/>
Ages, that the greateſt Libertines and Oppreſſours are for the moſt part Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſwim in Pleaſures and Delights, whilſt the Vertuous and Innocent are generally deſpis'd, and many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Miſery; or if ſome become more fortunate, it is preſently attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Deity they Invoke; when yet others, much more in Number, and no leſs conſtant in imploring the Mercies of Heaven, notwithſtanding all their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, become a Prey to Impiety; being either Sacrific'd to the Exactions of Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or trampled on by the Voluptuous and Proud, or perhaps Plunder'd at the Will and Pleaſure of a Tyrant; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the methods of a tedious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Sickneſs; or blaſted by Defamations and Slanders; or afflicted with an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Family; with many ſuch like Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Diſaſters. Upon which Account, when one told <hi>Diagoras, Thou who doſt believe that the Gods neglect Mens ſafety, doſt thou not obſerve the contrary, from the many Pictures or Votive Tables hung upon their Temples, by thoſe who eſcap'd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack? Very true,</hi> reply'd <hi>Diagoras, for there are no Pictures of thoſe who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this Calumny, and all the Parts and Members of it: Firſt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100786:59"/>
Good men may not be ſucceſsful in what they pray for, becauſe they do not uſe the Means. The Husband-man in the Fable, finding his Waggon ſtuck in the Dirt, lays down his Whip, and calls on <hi>Hercules</hi> for help; to whom the God made anſwer, Riſe, Fool, and uſe thy Whip, and put thy Shoulders to the Wheels, and then call on <hi>Hercules</hi> and he will ſuccour thee. God does not work Miracles to ſupply the Sloth of men. Secondly, though men may uſe their beſt Endeavours for attaining what they pray for, they may be unſucceſsful neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by propoſing undue Ends. This man asks for Riches, that he may paſs the remainder of his Life in ſoftneſs and delight; that man ſues for Honour, and the Grace and Favour of his Prince, that he may ſhew a Grandure in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding others, and receiving Marks of Homage and Obedience. Thirdly, Tho' the thing we pray for may be Honeſt and the End Good, yet God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to grant it, becauſe it may not be Beneficial; or if of preſent Benefit, yet of future and durable Inconvenience; which made the Heathen cry out, <hi>Nam pro jucundis aptiſſima quaeque dabunt Dii:</hi> The Gods, inſtead of what ſeems plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, may anſwer us another way, by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100786:60"/>
giving us what is fitting and uſeful. But if the Subject of mens Prayers be the Preventing of ſome Evil which threatens us, or perhaps the Removal of ſomething which afflicts us, yet may we be unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful without any Reproach to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, upon theſe two Conſiderations: Firſt, The Evil which we deprecate, may be deſign'd only for Correction and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; this is no more ſtrange, than to ſee the Surgeon, whoſe help we implore to remove a Pain, inſtead of giving preſent eaſe, to fall a-cutting and burning, and perhaps diſmembring. Secondly, God may lay Calamities and Afflictions upon men, that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Nobler Acts of Virtue. The Stock from which the Husband-man expects the choiceſt Fruit is prun'd moſt, and muſt often bleed, by ſuffering his Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Branches to be cut away; whereas Common Trees have been ſuffer'd to grow at random, and to ſpread wide their Arms, that they may afford more Fuel for the Fire. This the Heathens underſtood perfectly, in the Temple which they built to Honour, which was ſo plac'd, that there was no entrance to it but by that of Virtue, whoſe Nature conſiſts in Fortitude, and whoſe Object is Difficulty and Danger. <hi>Aeneas</hi> is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100786:60"/>
as a Pattern of Heroick Virtue, whilſt he is expos'd to Burnings and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, toſs'd from Shore to Shore, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made to feel the ſtrokes of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Deity; all which ſerv'd but to render him more firm and reſolute in his Actions, being like the Armour he wore, which was made impenetrable, by being wrought in the Fire, by being forg'd and beaten upon the Anvil, and dipt in the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake.</p>
            <p>Further yet; Divine Providence may ſuffer Good men to be a long time under Diſgraces and Afflictions, to render re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd Comforts more dear and affecting. The longer men have lain in Chains and Captivity, the greater is the Jubile by which they are reſtor'd to Liberty: 'Tis like a Pardon upon the Point of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the Fears of Death yield ſtronger Fuel and Vigour to Life: How ſweetly does a man who is deliver'd from the ſharp Aſſaults of the Gout, taſte the Pleaſures of Health? how thankful is he for the Benefit, and what eſteem has he for the Means by which he was reſtor'd?</p>
            <p>In the laſt Place; Though Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould never withdraw the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune under which we groan, yet is this no Argument that we are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it: on the contrary, it is the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100786:61"/>
beſt Argument in the World to ſupport us under it, it being utterly inconſiſtent with the Nature and Goodneſs of God, to ſuffer Innocence to be oppreſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Reward; which, becauſe it is not found in this Life, it remains, that there is a future State after Death, where Virtue ſhall be Crown'd: But this I ſhall wave at preſent, as being founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul's Immortality; a Point, which by the method of this Argument, may be diſcours'd upon hereafter; for at preſent I ſhall decline all Topicks taken from the Truth and Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, till I ſhall arrive to it by the Courſe and Progreſs of Reaſon. Upon this Proſpect, which the wiſer Heathens had of a future State after death, they bravely endur'd the Inſults of Fortune, and triumph'd over the Cruelty of thoſe by whom they ſuffer'd. <hi>Theramenes</hi> being Condemn'd by the Thirty Tyrants of <hi>Athens,</hi> took the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cup into his Hand and drank to <hi>Critias,</hi> who was the moſt active man amongſt them to pronounce the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <q>Brave gallantry in him, to behold Death with an undaunted Countenance, and drink his Enemies Health in his own Poiſon! <hi>Socrates</hi> not long after, was, by the Command of his Judges, Condemn'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100786:61"/>
to the ſame Priſon, and to drink of the ſame Poiſonous Cup, which being about to take off, he diſcours'd after this manner: I have great hopes, my Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it will be well with me that I am condemn'd to die; for one of theſe two Things are certain, either that Death ſhall extinguiſh all Senſe, or Tranſlate us into another Place; if all Senſe be extinguiſh'd, Death certainly is but like a ſound ſleep, which is then moſt pleaſing and natural, when it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Fantaſms of a Dream. Good God! How great Profit is it for me to die! or who can be more Happy than I? But if it be true (as men ſay) that Death is nothing but a Migrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into thoſe Regions which men In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit after this Life, thou art yet more happy, ſince thou ſhalt be deliver'd from them who would now be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judges, that thou maiſt go over to thoſe who are Judges indeed; ſuch as <hi>Minos, Rhadamanthus, Aeacus,</hi> and <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> and there Converſe with thoſe who have liv'd Juſtly. What would you not give to diſcourſe with <hi>Orpheus, Muſaeus,</hi> and <hi>Homer?</hi> Truly I would die often if it were poſſible, that I might Experiment the Truth of theſe things; nor would ſuch of you
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100786:62"/>
amongſt my Judges, who declar'd me Innocent, fear to die: For no Evil can happen to a good man whether living or Dead; nor can his Concerns be neglected by the Immortal Gods: Nor does this happen to me by chance, no more than I would have Cauſe to be offended with thoſe by whom I am Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd and Condemn'd, were it not that they thought they did me hurt. Thus it fares with me, and better it cannot be: But 'tis time for me to go hence; I to my Death, you to your Life, but of the two which is beſt, is known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Immortal Gods.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having Vindicated Divine Providence from that Part of the Objection which concerns the Misfortunes of Good men, let us look a little towards the other Scale, in which the Properiety of Evil men is caſt, and ſee whether it be of that weight and moment, as to turn the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Juſtice. I ſhall not inſiſt upon the momentary Eſtate of ſuch men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which vaniſh ſuddenly like thoſe gaudy Butter-flies, which are engender'd and flutter in the Sun-ſhine: No, let us bring the Matter under an Impartial Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, with whatſoever may advantage the Conditions of ſuch men, and we ſhall find the Equity of God's Diſpenſations in theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100786:62"/>
Firſt; thoſe ſeeming Darlings of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, notwithſtanding all their Luſtre and Parade, are commonly travers'd in their Courſe of Life with ſome Diſaſters, which embitter all their Pleaſures and Enjoyments: Here we find a Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Sinner, who Flatters his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, Inſults upon his Inferiours, and Cajolls his Equals, with all ſeeming Kindneſs: He lives Jollily and Gay, treats often, and drinks at all, even from the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the beſt in Chriſtendom: In fine, he paſſes in the Eyes of moſt men for a Popular and Happy man; when all this while there lies an unlucky Mortgage perhaps, which feeds day and night upon his Eſtate, and which obliges him to pay ſecretly ſome Homage Fees to Keepers, Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles and Under-Sheriffs; nor does he want ſometimes the Comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a Jayl. But admit his Fortunes lie without the reach of ſuch miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Engines, yet 'tis poſſible he may find other Diſcomforts from his Family which may poiſon his Content. The Wife of his Boſom may wound him with Jealouſie; or if Chaſt, ſhe may be Profuſe, Imperious and Importunate; that if there be nothing of all this, yet 'tis more than probable, that ſome one
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100786:63"/>
or other of his Children may give him matter of conſtant diſturbance; the Prop and Flower of his Family, even my young Maſter the Squire, and his hopeful Heir, may be an Impudent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht Rogue, perhaps a Fool: For ſuch, as they are the common Inſtruments, ſo are they as commonly the choice Maſter-pieces and Workmanſhip of Knaves.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, admit the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Evil men to have no bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of another kind, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs 'tis certain, that even in their own Nature there is bred ſomething which is deſtructive to the welfare of the Subject it belongs to. The moſt Luxuriant Trees die ſooneſt of the Canker, which they themſelves nouriſh. The Rich Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner paſſes with moſt for a very notable man. He thrives daily in the World, which he ſeems to Command by the help of his Money; (for amongſt the Vulgar all mens Gentility, Merits, and Quality, are meaſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by the Acre) and yet who knows not by what Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Practices ſuch a Perſon works; What Anxiety is there which fills his Thoughts? How is he ever tormented with his own Fears, and ſometimes with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Guilt? He places his Felicity
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100786:63"/>
in a bare acquiſition, whilſt he himſelf commonly wants all thoſe Comforts his Money might procure: His Sleep is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd with Apparitions, and ſometimes with real Alarms of thoſe who viſit his Coffers. There is another who places his Felicity in a full Enjoyment of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lies within the reach of Fancy: He ſtuffs his Carcaſs with moſt delicious Wines, and with whatſoever Rarety is to be found amongſt the Living, or to ſpeak more properly, amongſt the Dead: He is always hunting out for Fuel for his Lechery, and ſo paſſes away his Time amidſt Feaſts, Courtſhips, and the Divertiſements of the Night: Till at length he finds himſelf arreſted by a rude Fit of the Gout, or of a Dropſie, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a worſe Diſtemper: The next News we hear of him is, that he is beleagur'd with the whole Faculty of Doctors, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, and Surgeons, with their Auxiliaries, who very regularly inveſt his Body, and formally attack it too, with all the Inſtruments and Artillery of Art; Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications, Cauſticks, Salivations, and Circumciſions are hard things for the poor Patient to underſtand, but much harder for him to undergo. And here I leave them to diſpute the Point with Nature, being no more concern'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100786:64"/>
               <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> get the better over him, than I ſhould be for the Proudeſt and moſt Puiſſant man alive, ſhould I ſee him ſtrut with a more Puiſſant <hi>Cancer,</hi> or ride in triumph with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Fiſtula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then for the Ambitious Perſon, how Happy ſoever he ſeems to be, he carries his Mortification with his State: He ſwells at the approach of thoſe who depend upon his Honour, whilſt he repays their humble Salutations with a new faſhion'd Grin, and anſwers their Petitions with a Shrug; or when diſpos'd to a Gracious Compliance, by an Emphatick Nod. With a man of this Kidney, the leaſt ſlight will be able to Create a Fever; and yet let ſuch a one be aſſur'd, that as he is never wanting to himſelf to give the Occaſion, ſo others will not fail to make good the Counter-point, and ſome time or other find an Opportunity to follow the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee with the Piquancy of Scorn. Others there are of this Tribe, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed another way, and by the Prudent Methods of a long-ſtudied Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Hypocriſie, crouch like Capuchins at the Feet of thoſe who may any way advance their Ambitious Ends; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, they labour to win the Fame and Acclamations of the Vulgar, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100786:64"/>
nothing like to that of being ſeen and talk'd of under the ſwelling Characters of Popular Greatneſs: Theſe are lookt upon as riſing and happy men; and ſo they are certainly, if Happineſs does conſiſt in the worſt of Slaveries, <hi>viz.</hi> A forc'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to the Paſſions of others in flat Contradiction to ones own Will and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; if it be happineſs to live in conſtant Jealouſies and Fears, and to be oblig'd ſometimes to act the Perfidious, and to expect always the ſame from others; if it be Happineſs to carry a Calmneſs in the Face, and a Tempeſt in the Breaſt, and ſo be depriv'd of all the ways of eaſe for want of vent. And as for common Fame, what is it but a puff of Breath, which perhaps may ſwell an empty piece of Skin into the dimenſions of a Bladder, and ſo be able to bear it up for a time, and make it ſwim upon the Surface of the Waters, maugre all the violence of the Winds and Floods, of the Storms and Waves? and yet for all this big appearance, give this riſing thin floating Excrement but a prick, and aways flies all the Breath which bore it up, and vaniſhes in the Maſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Air; and then there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this windy Greatneſs, but a poor thin piece of Matter, which ſhrinks
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100786:65"/>
into a little compaſs, and is ſoon loſt and caſt away. One peircing Glance of an offended Majeſty may ſtab the Fortunes of the greateſt Favourite, where his Fall perhaps will not be without Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and without good Conduct may prove a fatal Precipice.</p>
            <p>In the Third place, let us ſuppoſe yet further, that Wicked men ſhould enjoy all the Good things of this Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of Evil, either from the Nature and Concomitants of ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, or from any other Collateral Misfortune whatſoever, ſo that their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity may flow in upon them with a full Wind and Tide, and be as eaſie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited as their Wiſhes; yet there is one thing moſt certain, that they muſt have an End; which End too will as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give them a Proſpect of Two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Paſt and Future; if they look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they will doubtleſs feel remorſe of Conſcience; or if not, yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their good Fortune, if it were ſatisfactory, will augment their preſent Miſery; if empty, their Folly: But then if they look forwards, they will find themſelves ſurrounded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable Terrors: For though there were no ſuch thing as a Hell, yet the Apprehenſion of it, accompanied with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100786:65"/>
the Images of Guilt, is almoſt as bad: But if there be ſuch a thing as Hell, where are they then? But to this we ſhall ſpeak hereafter, when we ſhall enquire into the Soul's Immortality: ſo that upon all Conſiderations of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, there is no ground to believe any neglect on God's part in the Adminiſtration of Mens Concerns, from the Proſperity of wicked Men.</p>
            <p>But in the laſt place, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the mighty Objection, if it ſhall appear after all, that good men (tho not all) are more proſperous and happy in the outward Comforts and Delights of Life, than the Atheiſtical and Wicked. We find indeed glorious Examples of Great, Fortunate, and Vertuous Perſons in all Ages, Places, and Conditions of Life; even ſuch, who confining their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, within the proper Circles of Moderation and Temperance, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a better ſenſe of them than thoſe who puſh them on to Luxury and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit. And as they taſte them better, ſo have they this advantage alſo to make them the Inſtruments of Good to others; which cannot but procure to themſelves great Honour, and Tranquility of Mind for the preſent; as alſo a ſolid and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Monument of Glory through all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100786:66"/>
Ages. Riches, Honours, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of State are good and great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; they firſt furniſh Men with what may reaſonably advance their own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and then, like Gods, make them capable to derive a Happineſs to others. To theſe we owe the Erection and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Schools, Hoſpitals, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, Churches, Religious Houſes, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edifices, with other Monuments, which ſerve ſo much for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety, Good Manners, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Commerce. It is to good Kings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Counſels of Wiſe and Vertuous Stateſmen, to whom we owe the Sanction of wholſom Laws, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from Danger, with whatſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Welfare and Security of a Kingdom; ſo that even in this Life we may readily obſerve, that the Scale of Vertue does out-weigh.</p>
            <p>Before we leave this Branch of my Diſcourſe, there is one Objection, or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rather, touching the precedent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and 'tis this: The Events we meet with in all our Human Concerns, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inevitable, or ſuch as cannot but be; or Evitable, or ſuch as ſometimes, had not God in an unuſual and ſpecial manner interpos'd, had never been. If Inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then is it ſuperfluous and vain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100786:66"/>
the Evil which will fall upon us, tho we invoke Heaven never ſo much, as 'twould be ſuperfluous and fruitleſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate God for that which will befal us without our Application. But if ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are ſaid to be Evitable, then will it follow, that what Evil hath been, might not have been; which yet ſeems impoſſible: For whatſoever hath been at ſome time, was from all Eternity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by God that it ſhould be; and whatſoever God from all Eternity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw ſhould be, could not but be: now, that what could not but be, might yet have not been, is a palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>To this, which ſeems rather a Cavil or Sophiſm of the <hi>Stoick,</hi> than a ſolid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I anſwer: That things may be ſaid to be inevitable or Immutable in Two reſpects; either by an Inevitability of Nature; or by an inevitability of the Event; for inſtance: That Fuel ſhould burn is Inevitable from the Nature of Fire, whoſe inſeparable Property it is to burn; ſo that here to hinder the effect, is the ſame thing as to work a Miracle; but that the Fire ſhould have burnt my Houſe and not another Mans, this was neceſſary or Inevitable only in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or upon a ſuppoſition, that what
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100786:67"/>
was burnt could not but be burnt, or what was done could not be undone: and about theſe latter Caſes 'tis, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence does for the moſt part exerciſe it ſelf: So that we ſee how the ſame thing may be both Evitable and Inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table at the ſame time; Evitable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Cauſes or Occaſions leading to it; foraſmuch as there was no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the application of ſuch a Cauſe; which Cauſe notwithſtanding being once applied, or occaſioning ſuch an Effect, this Effect becomes Inevitable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Contingency in the Cauſes or Occaſions leading to it. Now when we offer up our Petitions to God, either to be delivered from Evil, or to receive Good at his Hands, our Addreſſes are not ſuperfluous; foraſmuch as it may ſometimes, and does frequently happen, that God may avert an impendent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or beſtow upon us an unexpected Good, by ſuch means as lie out of the ordinary courſe of Cauſes, and this too without a Miracle; whereas, had things run on in their natural Courſes, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent would have been far otherwiſe. The reaſonableneſs of our addreſſing of ourſelves to God in all our Exigencies, and in what way and manner, and upon what Grounds we may hope to find Succeſs,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100786:67"/>
hath been before declared. <hi>Deſine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Deûm flecti ſperare precando,</hi> was the Sally of a Poetick Fancy, ſhewing a Sentence already executed to be irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: What Judgment we are to paſs upon them before their Execution, or in relation to God's fore-knowledge, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing of them, will be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently diſcours'd of in the following Chapter: 'Tis ſufficient at preſent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as the end, ſo alſo the means fall both alike under God's Providential Inſpection: ſo that when Men pray to God with a good intent and purpoſe, they may conclude ſafely, that God is no leſs the Author of their good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations than of the Bleſſings they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore; and that if ſuch good Deſires be of his Bounty and Grace, they may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect his favourable Return to their Petitions, in ſome way or other, as ſhall be moſt ſuitable to the Wiſdom of the Giver, and to the Neceſſities of the Receiver.</p>
            <p>God in his Providential Concurrence with Men, deals with us as an Indulgent Mother does with her tender Infant; which being ſet upon its Feet attempts to go; but being ready to fall, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leads him by the Hand, or holds
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100786:68"/>
him by his Shoulder-ſtrings; by which means the weak Infant moves forwards, and the Mothers Hand follows or goes along with it, and ſuſtains it: But in caſe it draw near to the Fire, Water, or any place of danger, the Provident Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuccours it with greater ſtrength, and turns it another way, and then leaves it to its own little Wandrings, ſtill bearing it up for fear of falling: nay, ſometimes ſhe ſlackens her Hand a little, and ſuffers the Child to trip, or perhaps to fall gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Ground on purpoſe, that by ſuch little Slips or Hurts, it may learn to take more diligent heed to its Steps, and by this means learn alſo to walk ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and ſecurely. Now albeit the Child in theſe firſt Eſſays of Nature, could not be able by its own ſtrength to walk with ſafety; ſo neither is that Vertue or ſtrength with which the Parent aſſiſts its weak but innocent Child, ſufficient of it ſelf to perform the Motion; but both being join'd together, is that which ſets the Wheels of Nature going. And in ſuch wiſe like this it is, that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Paternal and Providential Care, to govern the Motions of Men, and to divert them ſometimes in caſe of impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Danger, or of ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100786:68"/>
Occaſion, by applying greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Vertue than what is uſual in his ordinary Concurrence with them.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Fate and Fortune.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEfore we leave our Obſevations upon Providence, there are Two things requiſite to be ſpoken to under Two Names, which much amus'd the Ancients, and which at this day alſo have their ſpecial Patrons and Abettors, <hi>viz.</hi> Fate and Fortune. I ſhall begin with Fate, which is generally underſtood to be no other than an irrevocable Sentence, or Decree of Heaven, by which Human Affairs are from all Eternity ordain'd, in ſuch wiſe, that they cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe: The abſurdity of which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is evident from hence; foraſmuch as it doth furniſh Men with a falſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for the Commiſſion of all manner of Villainies, by charging God to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, and of mans being neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto by his unalterable Decree. And as this Doctrine is full of Impiety in reſpect of God, ſo it contains no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Abſurdities in regard to Men: For according to theſe Maxims of Fatality,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100786:69"/>
there would be no occaſion for Men to make uſe of Ships to paſs over the Seas, nor of Meat to nouriſh them; for a man has no more to do but to walk boldly upon the Waters: For if it be not his Deſtiny to be drown'd, he needs not fear to venture; but if it be his Deſtiny, no Bottom can preſerve him: neither needs a Man to eat, for if it be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny to die by Famine, he'll never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it by eating; but if it be not his Deſtiny to die by Famine, he cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by forbearing. And yet this Doctrine, ſo abſurd as it is, is believ'd vulgarly by the <hi>Turks;</hi> tho we do not find the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it in their Practices, ſince in all their Exigencies of War, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Human Succours, and are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of deſpair. This Doctrine was at firſt taught by their Impoſture Prophet, to render them more adventurous and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in perillous Attempts.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not ſufficient to refute this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, by ſhewing the abſurdity of its Conſequence, but 'tis alſo requiſite to prove its falſhood, by ſhewing the Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Principles on which it is built. I ſhall not here enter into a Theological Diſcourſe of God's Decrees, and Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as they are treated of in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Method I propos'd does oblige
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100786:69"/>
me to ſpeak to theſe matters, ſo far only as they fall under the View and Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Reaſon; and this I have already done in ſome meaſure in the precedent Chapters: all that I ſhall add, or rather repeat at preſent, is, that the Source or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of Mens Errors in this particular, is their miſunderſtanding of theſe two grand Points, God's Preſcience, and God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation with Men. Firſt, as to God's fore-knowledge of Human Actions, this does not take away the Liberty in the Agent; for then God himſelf would not be a free Agent; ſince he has from all Eternity a fore-knowledge alſo of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hereafter he himſelf ſhall do. Now for our better underſtanding this Point, we may take notice, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Liberty; the one Natural, when a thing is done without Lett or Obſtacle. Thus a River is ſaid to run freely, when there is no impediment or ſtop in its Courſe; this kind of Liberty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys a Natural Neceſſity. A Second kind of Liberty is that which is term'd Spontaneous, proper only to Rational Creatures, and conſiſts in a Power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not doing a thing, and is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Coaction: which ſort of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho it imply a certainty of the effect, yet this certainty is deriv'd from the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100786:70"/>
Power of the Agent, which is free to act or not to Act; but being once ſuppos'd to act, it muſt of neceſſity produce the Effect which follows it. God therefore from all Eternity fore-ſees things ſo, and in no other manner than they ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after come to paſs, together with the means by which they ſhall be produc'd. In things which will be produc'd by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſity, he foreſees them as things which ſhall of neceſſity come to paſs by ſuch and ſuch means<hi>:</hi> Likewiſe in effects, which ſhall proceed from free Agents, he foreſees them alſo, as iſſuing freely from ſuch and ſuch Cauſes.</p>
            <p>As to Gods Cooperation and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Men in Acts purely natural or moral, this likewiſe has been already ſpoken to, there being no more on God's part, but that common and general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which he affords indifferently to all his Creatures, by which they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in their Being and Actions, whilſt each rational Creature moves after its own peculiar way. Thus we ſee how the Planets are all carried from Eaſt to Weſt by that General and Diurnal Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> whilſt at the ſame time they have a peculiar Motion to themſelves, different from that of the thing which does ſuſtain them, and ſets
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100786:70"/>
them too agoing. A Globe or Cylinder, being plac'd upon a Plate of poliſh'd Steel, and once impreſs'd with the leaſt touch, moves it ſelf from place to place. Now if ſuch power can be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to things purely ſenſeleſs and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, how much more eaſie is it for rational and free Agents, once inſpir'd with Life and Motion by God, to move themſelves by that Virtue they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with at their firſt beginnings? Beſides this general and natural Influx of God on the Actions of Rational Creatures, he is alſo ſaid to have a moral Influence, by inviting men to good Actions, and by detaining them from bad ones: yet this being no more than an Objective Influence, or ſuch as reſults from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions men have of Rewards and Puniſhments, it leaves them ſtill at their Liberty to Good or Evil, as we ſee by daily Experience. As for ſpiritual Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or thoſe of Grace, they require a ſpecial Influence from God; but theſe being things which have relation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, fall not under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſideration.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of Fate which does much amuſe the World, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be derived from the Stars. That the Planets have a great Influence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100786:71"/>
upon Nature, by cauſing that great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Seaſons, Climats, general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagions, exceſſive Rains and Drought, with other Events of this kind is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable: and ſince the Diverſities and Conſtitutions of Countries do naturally incline men to ſuch and ſuch Tempers; and ſuch Tempers naturally diſpoſe men to ſuch and ſuch Qualities; it follows, that the Heavens have a remote and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Influence alſo upon the Actions of men; yet not ſo as to controul and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them in their Liberty, ſince we find infinite Examples of men every where, who living under the ſame Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, are notwithſtanding of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Inclinations; and even Brethren, and ſometimes Twins (like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux)</hi> are led by different Studies, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue contrary Courſes of Life; or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Inclinations there be in Nature, they are eaſily overcome by the force of Example and Education. The Impoſtures of Aſtrologers, or ſuch as calculate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities are juſtly exploded by all men of Senſe and Learning. <hi>Condon,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt man who ever pretended to this ſort of Knowledge, was ſhamefully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his Judgment of <hi>Henry</hi> II. of <hi>France:</hi> for having calculated his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, he foretold that he ſhould live a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100786:71"/>
long and proſperous Life, when yet he was kill'd moſt unfortunately in a Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, and in the Flower of his Age. Men of this Profeſſion are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fortune-Tellers, yet very improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they pretending rather to predict mens Fates; whereas Fortune is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about matters of chance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency. The Stoicks, ſo much in vogue as they were, might paſs for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Moraliſts than Philoſophers, ſince they taught that all things were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Deſtiny, and yet that man's Happineſs, or the exerciſe of Vertue was a thing which lay within his own Power to acquire; Two Points diametrically oppoſite to one another.</p>
            <p>Fortune Combats Providence in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extreme with Fate, and amongſt the Ancients was held a Goddeſs; inſomuch that all variable and extraordinary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, whether good or evil, were aſcrib'd to her: tho <hi>Lucan</hi> in a Poetick Rage allows her neither to be a Goddeſs, nor that there was any Deity whatſoever, when he exclaims

intimating, that 'twas our Ignorance which gave the exiſtence to this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Deity; which certainly is not only ſound Philoſophy, but ſound Divinity: For if we conſider the matter a little, we ſhall find, that what was call'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is in reality no other but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; Providence in reſpect of the firſt Cauſe, who from all Eternity fore-ſaw the Event, and form'd Ends according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But Fortune in reſpect of the ſecond Cauſe, to whom it hapned beſides Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. A Father diſguiſedly drops Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his Garden, where his little Son is us'd to play; this he does to prove him whether he will bring it to him or keep it, or whether he be inclined to Theft or not: The Boy meeting with it, looks upon it as Fortune or Chance; at which the Father ſmiles to himſelf, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well for what end he did it. Here we ſee, that what was chance to the Child, is a thing of mature deliberation in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

A Wiſe General, deſigning to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize a City, ſends men diſguis'd like Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, who contrivedly throw a loaded Cart at the Gate or Entrance of it, as tho twere by ſome ſiniſter Accident: Whereupon the Soldiers who lay in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh win the Town: What then was a well-contriv'd Stratagem in the General, was look't upon we ſee by the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Citizens as a thing of Chance. Now if men who are all of the ſame natural Capacities, have yet in point of Conduct ſuch Power over others of the ſame kind, as to make them the Inſtruments of their own private Ends, unknown to thoſe by whom they are wrought, we may with certain reaſon conclude, there is a far more tranſcendent Power in God, who from that immenſe Proſpect he has of all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Things and Actions, and by himſelf giving Life and Soul to every living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may with infinite eaſe ſo diſpoſe of all the Events and Occurrences of man's Life, and to ſuch Ends and Purpoſes, as the wiſeſt Spirits can never penetrate: ſo that what ſeems to them to be but Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Contingencies, will be found in the Eye of the Wiſe Creator and Governor of the World, to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Effects of a prudent and moſt ſteady Counſel.</p>

            <p>FRom what has been hitherto prov'd through the Courſe and Connexion of the precedent Chapters, we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this farther Propoſition; That this God who is the Creator of the Univerſe, and preſides over all the Thoughts and Works of men, ought to be invok't and worſhipp'd<hi>:</hi> which Worſhip I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to theſe Four General Heads. Firſt, Adoration in reſpect of his Greatneſs, or as he is our Creator. Secondly, Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in reſpect of his Power, or as he is our Protector. Thirdly, Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in reſpect of his Goodneſs, and ſo he is our Benefactor: And Laſtly, Obedience, in reſpect of his Wiſdom, for ſo he is our Counſellor.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin firſt with Adoration: And here it is not my buſineſs to play the Critick, by ſhewing the ſeveral Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Word in Claſſick Authors; I leave theſe Curioſities to Grammarians, and ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with ſuch a Notion of it, as is moſt eaſie and obvious. By Adoration then, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100786:73"/>
nothing more but a profound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of our ſelves, expreſs'd by all External Geſts of Body, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an inward Horror of Mind, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apprehenſion we have of the Greatneſs and Luſtre of the Object; as upon the apprehenſion alſo of our own unworthineſs: Now that ſuch a kind of Worſhip (and much greater, if it were poſſible for us to expreſs it) is moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to God, is clearer than any thing we can bring to prove it by. Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereunto it is, that when we come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Inferiour Magiſtrate, we expreſs a Reſpect by outward Signs and a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Deportment; and ſo proportionably, the greater the Perſon is to whom we addreſs our ſelves. But when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd to the Speech and Notice of our Sovereign, we feel a kind of Terror upon our Apprehenſion of his Character; we ought to look upon him (as really he is) a Vice-God; which Conſideration cannot but teach us to approach his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as a thing which is Sacred, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and this we are ready to expreſs by an humble proſtration of our Bodies, and by an inward Awe of our Minds, and by a Reſignation of our Wills to his juſt Commands. With how much care and ſubmiſſion then ought we to approach
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100786:74"/>
the King of Kings, who gave us our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and is the great Judge and Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all our Deeds? we ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to throw our ſelves at his Feet, and to cover our Faces in the Duſt, and with a Religious Silence to attend his Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Of all the Heathen Idolaters, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeem'd the moſt excuſable in their Adoration of the Son, a Creature of Eximious Beauty and Greatneſs, of wonderful Influence in the Production of all things, and by whoſe Warmth and Light we are made ſenſible of all the Bleſſings and Delights of Life<hi>:</hi> And yet this material Sun is but a Shadow or fady Repreſentation of that inexpreſſible Glory which is inſeparable from God. Hence it was, that the Ancients did with all dread and ſtudied exactneſs celebrate their Religious Rites: They approach'd theſe Myſteries with a Reverential Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, looking on Taciturnity as a thing very eſſential to Holy Functions: whence come theſe Forms of Speech ſo much us'd by the Prieſts, <hi>Favete ore, Favete linguis,</hi> at ſuch time as they enter'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Religious Office: And as to their Ceremonies they were ſuperlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scrupulous; inſomuch that <hi>Sulpitius</hi> was degraded from the Prieſthood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

            <p>The Second Branch of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſts in Invocation, and this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows moſt Naturally from that Senſe we have of our dependance upon God, and of his Care and Government of the World. <q>For as <hi>Tully</hi> well argues, If <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Natura De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</note> the Gods cannot or will not help us; if they take no notice of what we do, or if in the Courſe of our Lives we derive no Benefit nor Succour from them, I know not upon what Ground it is, that we Worſhip them, and aſcribe Honours, and direct our Prayers to them; as I am doubtful alſo, that if our Piety towards the Immortal Gods ſhould once ceaſe and be neglected, but that even Faith, Honeſty, Juſtice, and Vertue, with whatſoever elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Civil Society, would ſoon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and be forgotten</q>—<q>This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration he improves further, when he tells us, That the Worſhip of the Gods muſt be moſt Chaſt, moſt Holy, and moſt full of Piety, and muſt therefore iſſue from a Pure, Sincere, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Mind: For as much as not only the Philoſophers, but even our Anceſtors, ever made a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Religion and Superſtition. They
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100786:75"/>
who Sacrific'd and Pray'd whole days together, <hi>ut ſui liberi ſibi ſuperſtites eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> that their Children might ſurvive them, are called Superſtitious, which Appellation afterwards became of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent; but they who did dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ponder on whatſoever related to the Service of the Gods, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Religious <hi>ex Relegendo,</hi> from their frequent and repeated Meditations on that Subject.</q> Whoſoever has but lightly read the Monuments of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot but obſerve, that in all their Worldly Affairs, whether of Peace or War, for chooſing their Magiſtrates, or for any other Function whatſoever, the firſt thing they did was to offer up their Prayers, to obſerve their Augurs, and to perform ſome Sacred Rites. Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts in Three Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, when we pray for ſomething which we want: Deprecation, when we pray to be deliver'd from ſomething we ſuffer, or are afraid of; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interceſſion, when we pray for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And yet Supplication amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> comprehended Deprecation, and ſignified alſo Thankſgiving, as will appear in the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>The Third Branch of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is Thankfulneſs to God, as our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100786:75"/>
Bountiful Benefactor: Gratitude is a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo rivetted in Nature, that thoſe who deviate from it are more degnerate than Beaſts, ſince the moſt Savage Animals become tractable and gentle to thoſe by whom they are nouriſh'd, and ſome have requited the Benefit they have receiv'd, after a long courſe of Time, in a way very Extraordinary and Miraculous; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have pin'd away and died for Grief at the Graves of their Maſters; and even Dogs, which are naturally moſt Fierce and Ravenous, will ſtill expreſs a Love for thoſe by whom they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd and fed, not only by a familiar Fondneſs, but by an uncorrupted Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for their Maſter's Safety and Concerns. Now if Beaſts are thus ſenſible of their Obligation, and expreſs, though dumb, their Gratitude to their fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what infinite meaſures of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs are due from Man towards God, from whom he derives his Life with all his Enjoyments. The Heathens, though they had no other Light but that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had a clear ſight of their Duty in this Particular, in the many Games they Inſtituted to the Memory of their Gods, for ſome remarkable Benefits they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> beſides their <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> Games ſo much Celebrated, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100786:76"/>

In Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo had their ſolemn Games in Honour of their Gods: Thoſe of the <hi>Circus</hi> were Sacred to <hi>Neptune,</hi> their <hi>Scenick Shews</hi> began about the 394. Year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> at ſuch time as they were direly afflicted with Peſtilence, and were firſt brought thither and Practis'd by the <hi>Etrurians,</hi> a moſt Superſtitious ſort of People, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> ever held in great Veneration in Matters of Religious Rites. But beſides their Games, the Ancients had other Monuments to teſtifie their Obligation to Divine Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Their Firſt Fruits, their Votive Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Tenth of their Spoils, their Trophies, together with their Altars and Temples, were all as ſo many laſting Marks of Thanks for the Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they receiv'd.</p>

The Laſt Branch of Divine Worſhip reſpects God as our Counſellor, being grounded in our Obedience and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Will, upon the Account of his Wiſdom and Juſtice. This as it is the laſt, ſo is it the chiefeſt Duty of a Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mind, as being the Center of that Repoſe which a man feels within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, upon the Belief he has of a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Providence, which cannot but Order all his Concerns in the beſt and wiſeſt way.

Life as though I were born for the ſake of others, and upon this Score I ſhall ever be thankful: Whatſoever I Poſſeſs ſhall not be hoarded up ſordidly, nor waſted profuſely, believing ever, that I do poſſeſs no more than what I am able to employ to good Uſes. I ſhall not meaſure Benefits by their Bulk and Number, but rather value them by the Worth of the Receiver, never deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too much which is beſtow'd upon a deſerving Perſon.

were the Endeavours of the Ancients, not only in preſerving, but alſo in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying their Religion, that there were ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> by Order of the Senate, Ten Youths of the Nobleſt Hopes and Families, who were recommended to the like Number of Cities in <hi>Etruria,</hi> there to be Imbued and Diſciplin'd in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Myſteries.</p>
            <p>The Religion of the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apud A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand. ab Alexand. lib. Genial. Dier.</note> as to its Hiſtory, is ſomething intricate and perplext. Nevertheleſs I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give ſome ſmall Account of it, as I find it Recorded; and this too in the cleareſt and ſhorteſt Method that I can; this being very Preparatory to the main Scope and Deſign I have in hand. The Sum of what I meet with then upon this Subject, may be reduc'd under theſe Two General Heads, Religious Perſons and Religious Offices. As to Religious Perſons, they were of two ſorts, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Augurs:</hi> Firſt I ſhall begin with their Prieſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the firſt Founder of Religion amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Prieſt or <hi>Pontifex.</hi> Afterwards there was a College of theſe <hi>Pontifices,</hi> which at firſt conſiſted only of Four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but in courſe of Time, as the Empire grew greater and greater, this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100786:79"/>
College had its enlargments alſo, ſo that <hi>Sylla</hi> made their Number to be Fifteen; amongſt whom there was one who Govern'd the reſt, who was called <hi>Pontifex Maximus:</hi> It belong'd to this College to Inſtitute and Interpret Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies both Publick and Private, and to determine what Gods were to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd, and with what Altars, Temples, and Sacrifices: 'Twas their Buſineſs alſo to appoint Holy-days, called <hi>Feriae,</hi> on which men ceas'd from their ordinary Employments, that they might with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Devotion attend on Sacred Duties. Moreover it did belong to them to ſee that the Worſhip of the Gods was not Corrupted, by introducing Foreign Rites and Ceremonies, and to take care of what related to Funeral Rites and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture; and to Preſcribe Forms of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Ghoſts of the Dead, by certain Rites and Sacrifices, called <hi>Inferiae;</hi> to conſider alſo of Vows, and to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Publick Forms of Prayer and Supplications, or ſolemn Proceſſions. 'Twas the Duty of the <hi>Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> to make Annals of what was done or happen'd, and to enter the ſame into a Regiſter call'd <hi>Album;</hi> in which Book alſo were enter'd all Publick Decrees and Conſtitutions, together with the Names
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100786:79"/>
ſometimes of thoſe who bore Office. In fine, it was his Province to preſide over the College of <hi>Pontifices,</hi> to whom alſo the <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi> the <hi>Augurs,</hi> the <hi>Flamines</hi> and Veſtal Virgins were ſubject, and puniſhable by his Cenſor. The Function of the Pontificate was ever held in ſo great Veneration, that the chiefeſt Magiſtrates were ambitious of it, ſuch as <hi>Licinius Craſſus, Julius Caeſar,</hi> and many others: And in token of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, the <hi>Pontifex</hi> was allow'd his <hi>Lictor</hi> or Sergeant, with his Ax and Rods: He was allow'd alſo his Litter, and a <hi>Curule Chair,</hi> or Seat of State, with other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments proper only to the greateſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Nor was any man capable of this Sacred Employ, but ſuch as had born ſome Office of State; and withal, he was not like other Magiſtrates, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to give Account of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Charge. This Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Prieſts were called <hi>Pontifices,</hi> from a Wooden Bridge in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Pons Sublicius,</hi> which they were oblig'd to maintain, and was held ſo Sacred, that whenſoever it was to be repair'd (as it was often) nothing could be done till the Victim was ſlain, and the Work made auſpicious by a ſolemn Sacrifice. This Cuſtom ſtill continu'd till the Times
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100786:80"/>
of <hi>Aemylius</hi> the Treaſurer, who built this Bridge of Stone. The Scribes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Officers of this Sacred College were call'd <hi>Pontifices Minores,</hi> and perform'd alſo ſome Sacred and Inferiour Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>There was one amongſt the Prieſts, who was called <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi> for as much as he was appointed to exerciſe theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Functions, which belong'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Kings. But the Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being aboliſh'd, they conferr'd their Religious Power on this Officer; and leaſt the Name of <hi>Rex</hi> might create in him any deſire of Empire and Regal Dominion, they made him utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any Military or Civil Office, confining his Authority only to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rites, over which he did preſide. And particularly it did belong to the <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi> to Sacrifice a Ram to <hi>Janus</hi> upon the Fifth of the Ides of <hi>January.</hi> In all their Sacred Banquets, or Pontificial Feaſts, he ſate next to the <hi>Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and above the <hi>Flamines</hi> of <hi>Jupiter, Mars</hi> and <hi>Romulus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Flamines</hi> had their Original from <hi>Numa,</hi> who Inſtituted one that was call'd <hi>Dialis,</hi> or the Prieſt of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to whom were added two more <hi>Flamines</hi> or Prieſts, one who preſided over the Service or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100786:80"/>
Functions of <hi>Mars,</hi> called <hi>Martialis;</hi> the other over thoſe of <hi>Romulus,</hi> called <hi>Quirinalis;</hi> but in after Times the Number of the <hi>Flamines</hi> was augmented alſo to Fifteen, all which were denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the reſpective Gods, to whoſe Service they were appointed. Every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict or Ward alſo had its <hi>Flamines</hi> or Prieſts, who like our Biſhops were called <hi>Curiales.</hi> Moreover, in every Tribe or Ward there were appointed other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Miniſters, whoſe Buſineſs it was to perform Religious Duties up and down the Villages, for the Devotion and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Common People, much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our Pariſh Prieſts. They were called <hi>Flamines, quaſi Filamines;</hi> for when by the extremity of Heat they could not wear their Caps or Bonnets peculiar to their Order, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to bind their Heads, with a ſmall Filet or Ribband, in form of a Diadem, it being forbidden them to be ſeen at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time altogether bare-headed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever on Feſtivals, and at Solemn times of Officiating, they were oblig'd to wear their Bonnets, though the heat were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great; which Bonnets had a ſmall Rod of Olives faſtned on them, at the Top whereof ſtuck a little Tuft or Boſs of Cotton. There were alſo other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100786:81"/>
of Prieſts, of great Antiquity, as the Prieſts of <hi>Mars,</hi> called <hi>Salii (à ſaliendo)</hi> from dancing about the Streets on ſolemn days, and beating their little Swords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sacred Shields, made in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that which was ſaid to be ſent from Heaven in the time of <hi>Numa,</hi> wherein conſiſted the Fate and Safety of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Luperci</hi> or Prieſts of <hi>Pan</hi> were ſaid to be Inſtituted by <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> upon the Death of their Grand-Father <hi>Numitor.</hi> They were us'd to run about the Streets naked, having only a Goats Skin over them, and with ſmall Thongs of Goats Leather dipt in the Blood of the Sacrifice, they us'd to ſtrike the Palms of the Hands of ſuch Women as deſir'd Fecundity. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> alſo had a Fraternity of Prieſts called <hi>Arvales,</hi> appointed by <hi>Romulus</hi> for the Benediction of the Corn Fields, with many other Orders alſo, too long to be now inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Augurs</hi> were a Society of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, who were lookt upon as the <hi>Internuncii</hi> or Interpreters of the Gods, and muuh differing in Office from the Prieſts. Their Number was ſmall at firſt, growing greater and greater, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the extent of the Empire. Their College was Compos'd of Twenty
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100786:81"/>
four Members in the time of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip. They were ſaid to be Inſtituted by <hi>Romulus,</hi> who himſelf was a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert <hi>Augur.</hi> It was their Office to Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate future Events from the flight and chattering of Birds, to inſpect the Entrails of Beaſts, and interpret Dreams, as alſo to make a Judgment of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and Monſters, of Tempeſts, Thunders and Earthquakes: To explain Oracles and the Prophecies of the <hi>Sybills.</hi> They were alſo Judges of the Election of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, in ſo much that the Dictators, Conſuls and Praetors, with other Officers of greateſt Power, were oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the <hi>Augurs,</hi> if their Promotion did appear to be Un-canonical and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; alſo they could diſſolve their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and ſuſpend Proceedings, if things appear'd inauſpicious. Moreover they held their Office for Term of Life, whereas the <hi>Pontifices</hi> might be degraded from the Prieſthood for divers Cauſes. No wonder then if the greateſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates were ambitious of this Office. <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> is ſaid to have held the Augur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Sixty two years unto his Death; and <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> when he uſurp'd all the great Offices upon his ſubverſion of the Common-wealth, aſſum'd alſo that of the Augurſhip, as appears by the <hi>Lituus</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:100786:82"/>
on his Money. The <hi>Augurs</hi> were us'd to make their Obſervations ſitting, and wore a Veil upon their Heads, and were cloath'd with a long Robe or Veſt of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Scarlet. He had alſo a crooked Staff in his Hand, and winding at the end like a Rams-horn, call'd a <hi>Lituus,</hi> with which he markt and quarter'd out the Heavens into ſeveral Regions: After this a Victim being ſlain, he recited cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Forms of Prayers or Verſes, and then with Eyes directed towards Heaven, he applied himſelf with a profound ſilence and attention to make his Obſervations, and for the better performance of theſe Rites, the <hi>Augurs</hi> ever made choice of the open Campaign, and of the faireſt days, leaſt their Obſervations ſhould be obſtructed by the Winds and Clouds. Neither was it lawful for all the <hi>Augurs,</hi> but only for the Preſident of the College, to make a Judgment from the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Religious Functions amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were generally theſe Three. Firſt, Sacrifices: Secondly, Luſtrations: and Laſtly Supplications. The Sacrifices were of two kinds; Firſt, thoſe by which they enquir'd into the Will of God by Obſervation of the Entrails, and theſe might be call'd Exploratory: Next
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100786:82"/>
ſuch, where the Life of the Beaſt was Conſecrated to God, and this kind of Sacrifices might be call'd Animal, and might be term'd alſo Expiatory, ſince by theſe they endeavour'd to appeaſe the Anger of their Gods; though they were ſometimes offer'd up alſo to make them Propitious; and ſometimes alſo as Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gratitude. Each God had his peculiar Sacrifice. To <hi>Jupiter</hi> they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a whole Bullock without blemiſh, or any Spot of Black, and ſuch as had never been yok'd, though the <hi>Greeks</hi> were wont to Sacrifice a Ram. The Bull was Sacrific'd to <hi>Apollo, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> as a Goat to <hi>Pan;</hi> a Lamb to <hi>Juno,</hi> a Hart to <hi>Diana,</hi> and a Dove to <hi>Venus.</hi> To <hi>Ceres</hi> they Sacrific'd a Sow great with young; which kind of Sacrifice was called <hi>Amburvale;</hi> for at ſuch time as the Corn and Fruits began to be ripe, they led the Sacrifice thrice about the Fields, all the People following and ſinging cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Verſes ſuitable to the Occaſion; where one alſo was appointed to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Praiſes of <hi>Ceres</hi> by a ſolemn Hymn and Dance, and when they had made an Offering of Wine, Milk, and Honey, they kill'd the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to have been the Courſe and Method of their Sacrifices. Such a Beaſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100786:83"/>
being choſen out as was without Defect and Blemiſh, yet they caſt Fruits upon the Head of it, as alſo Meal temper'd with Salt and Water. This Compoſition was called <hi>Mola;</hi> from whence it was, that he who Sacrific'd was ſaid to <hi>Immolate;</hi> Moreover he ſprinkled Frankincenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Horns: This being done, the Victim was ſaid to be <hi>mactata;</hi> that is, duly prov'd and prepar'd. Being brought to the Altar, and before the Wine was pour'd on it, the Prieſt ſipp'd ſome of it in a little Diſh of Wood or Earth, called <hi>Sympulum,</hi> offering the ſame to thoſe who were round about him, that they might drink alſo. This Ceremony was called <hi>Libamen,</hi> as was that which follow'd, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Prieſt plucking only the Hairs that grew betwixt the Horns of the Victim, caſt them into the Fire; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turning himſelf towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> (for they ever Sacrific'd in the Morning with regard to the Riſing Sun) he ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew his Knife over the Back of the Sacrifice, from the Head to the hinder Parts. Theſe Ceremonies being over (which were called <hi>Prelibations)</hi> the Prieſt commanded the Miniſters who ſtood by (who were called <hi>Cultrarii,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Agones)</hi> to Immolate; that is, to kill and flay the Sacrifice, which being
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100786:83"/>
done with many Ceremonies, the Prieſt ſtrictly examin'd the Entrails, which he was not to touch with his Hands, but with ſome Hallowed Inſtrument appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe: And if they found all things proſperous, they did cut off ſome part or Portion of the Members or Bowels, which were called <hi>Primitiae;</hi> which being ſprinkled with Flour, were offered to the Sacrificer; who burnt them upon the Altar; what remain'd of the Sacrifice was boil'd or roaſted, and eaten by thoſe who aſſiſted at it: Tho ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all was burnt upon the Altar. Moreover they had a ſpecial Regard to this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Beaſt came wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or unwillingly to the Altar, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the latter as an Omen of ill Preſage, and that it was not acceptable to the Gods. All their Sacrifices were accompanied with Prayers and Hymns, in Honour of the Deity to whom they offer'd them: which Hymns or Verſes had ſeveral Names. That in praiſe of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was called a <hi>Paean,</hi> or <hi>Proſodia;</hi> of <hi>Bacchus, Dithyrambus;</hi> of <hi>Venus, Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> &amp;c. All which were accompanied with Muſick, and ſometimes with Dancing.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth our notice to conſider with what preparation the Prieſts addreſs'd themſelves to theſe ſolemn Sacrifices;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100786:84"/>
they purified themſelves with Water, and for ſome time before abſtain'd from all ſorts of Fleſh, and the uſe of <hi>Venus.</hi> Tho amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> many times, none were ſuffered to perform theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Functions, but ſuch as liv'd in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebacy: The Prieſt when he offer'd was attir'd in a long White Robe, and wore a Veil; and at ſuch time as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enter upon any Sacred Function, he endeavour'd to purge himſelf by a Confeſſion, and to expreſs his Sorrow and Penitence, not only by Words, but in the Humility of his Looks, having his Eyes fixt upon the Earth: whereupon the Officer or <hi>Praeco,</hi> cry'd aloud <hi>[Hoc age]</hi> thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all the People to be attentive to what they were about, and to keep ſilence: And ſo much briefly for their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>Their Luſtrations, Expiations, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications, were generally of Two ſorts: Firſt, By Ablution or Sprinkling of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Or, Secondly, by Fire, which was no other but Cenſing: and this was done ſeveral ways; either by the Leaves of Bays, Vervein and Myrtle caſt on burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals; or chiefly by Sulphur, and a piece of Pine-wood, in manner of a Torch, which was called <hi>Taeda;</hi> which by reaſon of its Roſin burnt eaſily, and yielded a kind of Perfume or Smoke,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100786:84"/>
(like that of Frankincenſe) as did alſo the forementioned Leaves; to which Smells they alſo attributed a purifying Virtue. Sometimes they us'd Oil and Pitch toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Sulphur: And ſometimes the Luſtration alſo was made by Sacrifices: All which kind of Rites and Ceremonies were us'd on divers Occaſions, and applied almoſt to every thing. But the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſpecially, with which <hi>Rome</hi> was luſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every Five Years, was a thing of great Pomp: This was perform'd in <hi>February;</hi> (ſo call'd from <hi>Febrius,</hi> who preſided o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Luſtration, to whom alſo they offer'd a Sacrifice,) at which time the Cenſor, in the greateſt Aſſembly of the Magiſtrates, invok'd the Tutelar Gods of <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſolemn Forms, <hi>viz.</hi> That they would defend the Empire, their Cities, Temples, and Waters from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; that they would be aſſiſting to them in times of difficulty, and avert Calamities: Vowing alſo ſomething at the next Luſtre; and then made their ſolemn Proceſſion about the City and Suburbs in this following Order<hi>:</hi> Firſt went the <hi>Pontifices;</hi> after them the <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> and <hi>Augurs,</hi> with other Inferior Prieſts: After theſe march'd the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals; then the <hi>Septem viri Epulorum,</hi> or thoſe who had the charge and ordering
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100786:85"/>
of the Pontifical Feaſts, who were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>Quindecim viri Saliorum,</hi> or the Maſters of the Sacred Rites; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Senators and Common People. And ſo ſcrupulous were they in their Ceremonies, that if an Owl or Wolf came at any time into the Capitol, the City was preſently to be Luſtrated, or purg'd by a Torch and Sulphur, and this was called <hi>Victima Amburvalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supplications amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were alſo ſolemn Proceſſions, and not much differing from their <hi>Quinquennial</hi> Luſtrations; only the latter was fixt to a certain Revolution of Years; whereas their Supplications were indicted upon ſome ſudden and extraordinary Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and they were of two kinds<hi>:</hi> Firſt, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratory: Secondly, Gratulatory. Their ordinary Supplications laſted only Nine Days, and were called <hi>Novemdialia:</hi> But beſides theſe, they made general Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications at ſuch time as they engag'd in any Foreign War, or when they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the defence of their Country, their Temples and Religion. Many times they had recourſe alſo to Supplications for the appeaſing of the Gods, as upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of Two Suns, or of Comets; as alſo in caſe of Earth-quakes, furious Tempeſts, Showers of Blood, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100786:85"/>
Inundations of <hi>Tyber;</hi> or when the Temples and Publick Edifices were ſtruck by Lightning; or upon any other Prodigy of this Nature. The <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> with the other Sacred Orders, began the Solemnity, and were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many times by the Senators, with their Wives and Children, together with the ſeveral Tribes: the young Men, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and Matrons alſo had their place and ſhare in the Ceremony, crown'd with Garlands, and with Laurels in their Hands, they ſang certain Verſes in a low and humble Voice, by which they implor'd the Mercy of the Gods; and ſo they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the Capitol and Temples; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe Sacred Chappels, in which were the <hi>Lectiſternia,</hi> or <hi>Pulvinaria;</hi> that is, Beds of Repoſe for the Gods; which Beds were moſt richly adorn'd, and had for their Pillows little Bundles, or Toſſels of <hi>Vervien</hi> (a Plant of moſt Sacred uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romans;)</hi> which <hi>Lectiſternia</hi> alſo were raiſed on high, and overlook'd the Altars. The chiefeſt Beds of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty were for <hi>Jupiter, Vulcan,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> becauſe theſe Three were chiefly look'd upon to have the Power of the Thunderbolt.</p>
            <p>The other ſort of Supplications were Gratulatory, much like our Jubilees, where
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100786:86"/>
all the Orders, both of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether Sacred or Civil, and cloath'd in their richeſt Ornaments and Habits, made like the Solemn Proceſſions in viſiting the Temples, and offering up their Thanks by ſinging of Hymns, Perfuming the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and making of Feaſts, with other Marks of Publick Joy; which Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laſted for many Days, and were granted upon the Account of ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Victory, or for the good Succeſs in their Wars, or any other publick Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> having fought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly in ſubduing the <hi>Gaules,</hi> obtain'd Supplications, or a Jubilee of Sixteen Days. <hi>Brutus,</hi> after he had the better of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> in the War of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> obtain'd a Jubilee which laſted Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days: One alſo of the like continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was indicted by <hi>Cicero</hi> in the Senate, at ſuch time as the War was proſperous to <hi>Octavius.</hi> Theſe Supplications were always made during the Abſence of the General, for whoſe ſake they were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excepting that of <hi>Cicero;</hi> for whom, tho preſent, a Supplication was indicted, in conſideration of the great Service he did in defending the Commonwealth from <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy. In ſhort, Theſe Supplications were uſually the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes of Triumphs: Foraſmuch as they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100786:86"/>
for whom Supplications were decreed, whilſt they were employ'd abroad in the War, obtain'd a Triumph at their Return when the War was finiſh'd.</p>
            <p>The Religion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was much the ſame with that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for they had the ſame Deities, and almoſt the ſame Rites and Sacrifices. From whence alſo we may proceed to take a tranſient View of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which conſiſted alſo in ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prieſts, Sacrifices, Luſtrations, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilees, Feaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only they differ'd in the Object of Worſhip, adoring the One True and only God, to whom they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted one only Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they perform'd their Solemn Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Tho they had their Synagogues or Sacred Aſſemblies alſo every where wherein they taught and preach'd, and did ſome leſſer Rites. Their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, as alſo Circumciſion, were the more diſtinguiſhing marks by which they differ'd from all the World. Tho the latter we find to have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alſo by the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> or <hi>Arabians,</hi> as deſcending from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prieſthood was ever held amongſt all Nations in great Eſteem, which they expreſs'd chiefly by honouring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe who attended on it with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100786:87"/>
glorious Titles, ſplendid Ornaments, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Maintenance, large Exemptions and Privileges, and with all External Marks of Obſervance and Veneration: If we do not find the ſame in the Age we live in, this in ſome meaſure poſſibly may be the fault of the Perſons themſelves; many of which being of deſpicable Parts and Extraction, of uncultivated Behaviour, and of Sordid, Covetous, and perhaps Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Lives, caſt a Cloud upon the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and had they liv'd amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, they would have been thought worthy of no other Prieſtly Employment but that of butchering the Beaſts; which yet ſeem to be much more innocent and gentle. Tho it be very probable alſo, that as Men decline in their Morals, and all Sentiments of Piety, ſo they think to extenuate their Enormities, by expoſing the Prieſts to the ſame Contempt under which they have brought themſelves by their degenerate Lives; which in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood will let in Atheiſm. For when Men have a true Belief of the Religion they profeſs, they cannot but ſhew a ſuitable Reſpect for thoſe who are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of conveying to them all the Benefits and Bleſſings of it. However it be, a few particular Deviations cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy univerſal Maxims, no more than the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100786:87"/>
Heavens can be ſaid to be impure and corruptible, from a few falling Meteors, or ſome ſmoaky Comets. The Body of Men through all Age and Regions of the World, have ever held Religion in high Veneration, as in ſome ſhort meaſure hath been already delivered. <q>So that to uſe the reaſonings of <hi>Tully,</hi> the Perſwaſion <note place="margin">Tuſcul. Quaeſt. lib. 1.</note> Men have of Religion, and of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is not founded upon any Conference and Conſent of men, nor derived from any Laws and Sanctions whatſoever: But the general Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all Nations in the belief of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, can be nothing elſe but the Law of Nature.</q> And conſequently hence it was, that many of thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in uſe amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were in uſe alſo amongſt the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and may ſtill be retain'd in the Church, as being of great ſignification, and ſuch as ſerve to expreſs mens inward Senſe and Veneration of the Divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Having thus took a tranſient View of ſome Religious Practices amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, I now return into my old Road; where I ſhall endeavour to make a more ſtrict Enquiry of the Truth and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion. Which that we may the better underſtand, I ſhall reduce Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100786:88"/>
to theſe Two Generals, Natural, and Reveal'd. By Natural Religion I underſtand ſuch Nations as Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and vertuous Perſons have arriv'd to by the light of Natural Reaſon. By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, I underſtand only ſuch Religions as are at this time in Vogue, and were pretended to be authorized by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Voice from Heaven: 'Tis true, all the Ancient Founders of Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended alſo to Revelation: But their Religion being Converſant about falſe Deities, and being extinct long ago, I ſhall now conſider ſuch different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as at this Day divide the World, and have the True God for the Object of their Worſhip, by whom alſo they believe it was reveal'd; and they are theſe Three: the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation and Religion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion there are Two things to be conſidered; its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and its Duration. Firſt for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: To us who are educated in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100786:88"/>
belief that the Old Teſtament is the Word of God, there is no place left for any Doubt or Queſtion: So that in this Point, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But then were we to diſpute with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Porphyrius, Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicus, Celſus,</hi> and the reſt, who denied the Divine Authority of the Scriptures; we muſt have recourſe to other Medium's, and ſuch to which theſe Diſſenters would ſtand. Leaving therefore the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which the Scriptures themſelves give of their own Authority, we ſhall find the validity of their credit demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable from ſuch Circumſtances and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Influences of Reaſon, as the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sceptick cannot poſſibly withſtand. The Proofs which I ſhall bring for the Authority of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion are three. The firſt is taken from a Conſideration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation in General. The Second from the Authority of the Old Teſtament. The laſt from the Certainty of its Predictions.</p>
            <p>And firſt for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: 'Tis well known, that as they were the leaſt, being confin'd to a narrow Tract of Ground, not exceeding One hundred and twenty Miles in length, and Forty in breadth; ſo were they a People of groſs Intellectuals, compar'd with the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:100786:89"/>
               <hi>Syrians,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded them: They were not any way addicted to the Philoſophy of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> nor to the Ancient Learning of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans;</hi> nor any way curious in Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inventions: They were not digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or diſtinguiſhed by Titles, but liv'd contentedly, and in a ſtate of Equality, each within the limits of his own Tribe, improving their Patrimony by all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of good Husbandry in manuring the Earth, and living frugally. From whence it appears plainly, that a People of this Genius could never invent ſuch a Religion as ſhould have the one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, the Great Creator of Heaven and Earth for the Scope and Object of their Adoration. Neither could they receive Notions of this Nature from any of their forementioned Neighbours; it being known to all the World, that all the Nations round about them were groſs Idolaters, and held no conformity with the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Rites and Manners of Life.</p>
            <p>We have a Deſcription of the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Purity of their Religion in the beſt of Heathen Authors: For <hi>Tacitus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tac. lib. 5. hiſtor.</note> tells us, that the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhipped one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deity, <hi>mente ſola;</hi> deteſting thoſe as prophane who repreſented the Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100786:89"/>
the groſs Shapes and Images of Men; believing the one Supreme God to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Immutable. But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Belief was, we find their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to be many times very dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
            <p>For our better illuſtration therefore of this Argument, 'twill not be amiſs to take a ſhort view of their Diſpoſitions and Actions, as they are repreſented to us in their own Acts and Monuments. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation were a People ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the reſt of men, by many ſignal Favours and Prerogatives. They had lain almoſt Four hundred Years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Yoke of <hi>Egypt;</hi> till at length (God remembring his Promiſes) does raiſe them up a Deliverer, <hi>Moſes;</hi> who by many Wonders reſcu'd them from under the Hand of the Oppreſſor. As for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, he overthrew them in the Red Sea: And 'twas but meet they ſhould be overwhelm'd in the Waters, who were firſt drown'd in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Impenitence. But for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to forget God, that God who had done ſo great things for them, was as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious as their very Deliverance. They left <hi>Egypt,</hi> 'tis true, but yet they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in the Land of Darkneſs, and were harder than the Rock which obey'd the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100786:90"/>
Rod, and yielded Waters to quench thoſe Heats which their own Luſts had firſt kindled. They reſiſted the Lord their Deliverer, in their Murmurings againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Nor did they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend with <hi>Moſes</hi> their Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; but they ſought the Prieſthood alſo, ſaying, <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congregation is holy, every one of them.</hi> And ſtrange was their Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, when they knew no other way to make an Atonement but by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sacrilege, I mean by offering up of ſtrange Fire, ſuch as made them both Prieſts and Sacrifice: And as tho all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Judgment, had been buried with <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company; they offer'd a freſh Indignity, ſaying, <hi>Ye have killed the people of the Lord:</hi> Inſomuch that God ſlew 14700 of them in a Moment. To be ſhort; whoſoever takes a Proſpect of their Forty Years Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in the Wilderneſs, ſhall find it to be chequer'd with Provocations and Judgments; and altho they melted in the Furnace, yet they return'd to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Temper when the heat was over, and became more hard and impenetrable by being wrought in the Fire. Nay, when they were reduc'd to that ſtate of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, under which they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100786:90"/>
to ſubſiſt, as being at the greateſt diſtance from Diviſibility, I mean a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; yet then, I ſay, when in the moſt flouriſhing ſtate, and in the moſt hopeful way to obtain ſtability, we find them at the ſame time turning Apoſtates from God, and Rebels to their Prince.</p>
            <p>To proceed then; when of all the Tribes, ſcarce the tenth part (which in all things elſe was conſecrated to God) became Followers of the True Religion: 'twas not long before that began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, and to turn away from the Truth: For 'tis recorded of the days of <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> that <hi>Judah</hi> did Evil in the ſight of the Lord, and that they provok'd him to Jealouſie, with the ſins they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted above all that their Fore-fathers had done: For they alſo built them High-Places, Groves and Images on every high Hill, and under every green Tree; there was not a Mountain but had Altars on it, and thoſe Altars almoſt as many and various as the Stars of Heaven, to whoſe Worſhip they were erected. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did God ſend to them by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by his Judgments, and by his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but all in vain; neither the one nor the other could perfect their Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and what was yet worſe, inſtead of turning to their God, we find them
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100786:91"/>
flying to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to that Idolatrous People to be heal'd and cur'd of their Wounds; like the dying Hart, which went to the Covert for ſhelter, from whence came the mortal Arrow. Nor did this Contagion overſpread the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, but many times their Kings, and ſometimes their Prieſts were infected with the Leproſie; all which Diſorders at laſt found an end in the Ruin of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Sanctuary, and City, together with the loſs of their Ark, and of all other Sacred Relicks and Monuments, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; all their Princes, Prieſts and men of Note, being loaded with Irons, and carried away like Slaves into dreadful Bondage and Captivity. Nay, after they were miraculouſly reſtor'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Reign, we find them expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to great Difficulties, and engag'd with Potent Enemies in their reſettlement; which indeed was rather a new kind of Combat than a Reſtauration; for it was Fourſcore years and better before the Temple and Walls of the City were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd; and not long after 'twas, that they were aſſaulted by dire Perſecutions, under the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who liv'd in <hi>Syria,</hi> as appears in the Acts and Records of the <hi>Machabees:</hi> After which time they fell into divers Factions and Diſorders, even
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100786:91"/>
to the Birth of Jeſus, after which ſhortly follow'd their final Extirpation.</p>
            <p>Now let us put all this together, and then let us make a Judgment of the whole. The Jews we ſee were a handful of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeparated from all the World by Language, Rites, and manner of Life: They were generally of heavy Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, obſtinate and moſt prone to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, their Kings alſo and Rulers being moſt of them Vicious and Idolaters; in Times of Peace eaſily drawn away to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Superſtition of their Neighbours, and at length broken to pieces by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Captivity; and even the ſcatter'd Fragments of their Nation batter'd by a continual ſeries of Calamities, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairable Diſorders. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe diſadvantages, we find their Religion to have been miraculouſly preſerv'd for the ſpace of Fifteen hundred years: For the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was never aboliſh'd, nor any new Rites introduc'd by the ſolemn Decrees of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> ſo that there was ſtill the Face of a Church, and Men rais'd up in an extraordinary manner to ſupport the ſame by their exemplary Lives and ſeaſonable Inſtructions; all which could not be but by the ſingular and ſpecial Power of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, when for ſo long a Tract of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100786:92"/>
Time all human Means univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd to the utter Ruin and Extirpation of it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of the Authority of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Divine Authority of the Books of the Old Teſtament, in which the Jewiſh Hiſtory and Religion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, may be demonſtrated firſt from the Matter and Manner of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; next from Records of human An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. And Firſt, The Old Teſtament has ſingular Advantages above any other Works and Writings whatſoever, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its Antiquity: It begins with the Creation of the World, with a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Antidiluvian Times, down to the general Deluge; after which time it ſhews the Re-ſettlement of Mankind; as alſo what Nations were of greateſt Antiquity, and then comes more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Anceſtors of the Jewiſh, and deſcribes the plainneſs of the firſt Ages in the Lives and Manners of their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs: From thence it deſcends gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Time of the Jews ſettling in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100786:92"/>
               <hi>Egypt</hi> in many delectable Paſſages, with ſome account alſo of the Neighbouring Nations. During their abode in <hi>Egypt</hi> we have little Account, till ſuch time as <hi>Moſes</hi> appear'd, to whom the Law was given. From <hi>Moſes</hi> downwards we have a more large and accurate Hiſtory, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd by ſeveral Succeſſions of Judges and Kings; and the years they govern'd reduc'd to certain Periods of Time, even to the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity; we have a particular Hiſtory alſo of their Re-ſettlement; and after ſome intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we have an Account of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the Government of their High-Prieſts, during their Wars with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Not long after which Time fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Birth of the Meſſiah. In ſhort, the Acts and Monuments of the Old Teſtament are of that Antiquity, that even the firſt Hiſtorians amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> flouriſh'd but about the time of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> who was one of the laſt amongſt the Jewiſh Writers.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, theſe Sacred Books have a ſingular Advantage above all other Writings whatſoever, whether we conſider the great variety of Matter contain'd in them, or the Stile in which they are writ. The Stile is for the moſt part very
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100786:93"/>
plain and obvious to all Capacities (as Books of this kind ought to be) but withal it ſpeaks with that Gravity and Authority, as becomes Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, not inſinuating its Precepts by Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Arts, but enjoyning them by a kind of Majeſty and ſevere Commands; and yet we have ſome Deſcriptions (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially amongſt the Prophets) made with that livelineſs of Repreſentation and grandeur of Expreſſion, as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Raptures of our Modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, or thoſe of former Ages. What Strains of Wit can draw ſuch an Idea of a Glorious Combatant as that we meet with in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cap. 63. in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he gives us of our Saviour's Bloody, but Victorious Conflict upon the Croſs. <hi>Who is he that cometh from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength?</hi> (Anſw.) <hi>I that ſpeak in righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave.</hi> (Queſt.) <hi>Wherefore art thou red in thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and thy garments like him that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Wine-preſs?</hi> (Anſw.) <hi>I have troden the Wine-preſs alone, and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my garments, and I will ſtain all my rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:100786:93"/>
               <hi>And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondred that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought ſalvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me. And I will tread down the people in mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their ſtrength to the earth.</hi> Can there be form'd a nobler Image of a Conqueror, dapled with Blood, wreeking with Revenge, and panting and beſtriding his proſtrate Enemy in the ſight of two Armies? How far ſhort of this is <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Character in his Combat with <hi>Turnus,</hi> deſcrib'd by <hi>Virgil?</hi> So that <hi>Angelus Politianus</hi> ſhew'd a ſingular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, or rather a critical weakneſs, in neglecting to read theſe Sacred Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for fear of debaſing his Stile; whereas <hi>Marſilius, Ficinus,</hi> and <hi>John Picus Mirandula,</hi> Men of greater Parts and Learning, delighted in nothing more than in the ſtudy of them.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the variety of Matter treated of in theſe Sacred Writings, there is no Collection under Heaven can compare with them; what excellent Obſervations and Inſtructions have we for Morality in the Books of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> which without an Hyperbole, may be ſaid to be the beſt in that kind in the whole world, as reaching to all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100786:94"/>
of Life. The Books of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> muſt tell a Heathen, that he was a Man of vaſt Knowledge: His <hi>Canticles</hi> ſhew him to have been a Man of a moſt pregnant Fancy: His <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> ſeems to have been a Diſcourſe by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue betwixt Wiſdom and a Senſual Nature: But his <hi>Proverbs</hi> do declare him to have been both Good and Wiſe, and were writ probably before he was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The Books of the Prophets ſhew that they were writ by Men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid Reſolutions: They reprove with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Flattery, and touch the Affections to the quick, breathing always an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Zeal for Vertue, and for the Glory of Almighty God. And as for the Book of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> they are a kind of Poem, and they muſt be confeſs'd of all Hands to flow from an inexhauſtible Fountain of Piety and Devotion, and teach us how we may Addreſs our ſelves to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral Forms of Confeſſion, Petition, Supplication, Thankſgiving, Vows and Praiſes: And truly, had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> been inſpir'd with a Human Spirit, he would have employ'd his Poetick Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in illuſtrating ſome Paſſages of his own Life, <hi>viz.</hi> His Fights and Victories as a Warriour, and particularly his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with <hi>Goliah,</hi> would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100786:94"/>
noble Matter for an Heroick Poem; or elſe as a Courtier he would have Compos'd ſome ſoft Paſtoral or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigal, containing his Amours with <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> or as a Friend, he would have exercis'd his Fancy about his more Innocent Love and Affection for <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi> But we find nothing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; his Subject always is Divine, one while as a Suppliant or Penitent, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while as an humble Petitioner; anon with Strains of Gratitude, and in Heavenly Raptures, he addreſſes himſelf to his Creator, and Celebrates the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Almighty God, by recounting his Wonders and Mercies, his Comforts and many Deliverances; all which cannot but ſhew, that they were dictated by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Spirit, and kindled by a purer Fire, than what commonly ſparkles in the gay Fancies and Inventions of Men. As for the Hiſtorical Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have touch'd upon them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and we may ſay of the whole Book or Collection of theſe Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that 'tis like the Manna it ſpeaks of; it is Food to every Palate, ſuch as does not nauſeate, but has a relliſhing Taſte of every thing, and creates an Appetite: And 'tis worth our Obſervation, that let a Man read theſe Holy Writings with all
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100786:95"/>
attention imaginable, yet when he comes to read them again, he ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome things of which he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant before, though he repeat the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them to the very end of his Life; which ſhews that tis a Spring which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible, and that the more we drink of theſe Waters, the more we thirſt; from whence it is, that the Wiſeſt and moſt Learned Men have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt to the reading of theſe Books, the nearer they drew towards their End, which ſhews alſo, that 'tis their Nature to lead Men forwards towards a State of further Perfection.</p>
            <p>Another thing which ſhews theſe Books to be of Divine Inſpiration, is the manner of their writing. Turn over all human Hiſtories whatſoever, and we ſhall ſtill find it to have been their grand Scope and Deſign, to magnifie their own Nation, and to repreſent their Actions with all advantageous Characters imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to applaud their own Cuſtoms and Manners, and to avouch the Juſtice of their Dealings: But 'tis otherwiſe in theſe Sacred Writings; the Pen-Men of them are in nothing more copious, than in ſhewing the Blemiſhes of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Apoſtacies, their Idolatrous Diſpoſitions, together with the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100786:95"/>
and ſcandalous Lapſes and Relapſes of their Kings, though held in never ſo great eſteem for Power and Goodneſs: And this certainly is an Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that they did not in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports proceed upon Natural and Human Conſiderations, but as it was dictated to them by a higher and more noble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and contrary to the Genius and Temper of that Nation, who in reality were as Vain, Self-admiring, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant as any other People upon the Face of the Earth. 'Tis beyond my Power to anſwer ſuch Difficulties as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the Old Teſtament, touching the Jewiſh Genealogies and Chronologies, together with ſome Cuſtoms and Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as ſeem ſtrange to us of this Age, ſince we find the like, and greater, in the Writings of all prophane Authors, though never ſo well digeſted; or perhaps God Almighty might on purpoſe ſuffer ſome Paſſages to be obſcure and ſeemingly Repugnant to our Underſtandings, the better to ſubjugate our Reaſon to Faith, which is a more excellent degree of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe it reſolves it ſelf into the abſolute Authority and Veracity of the Proponent without heſitance, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon our own feeble No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

In the laſt Place, the Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Sacred Writings is legible in the Acts and Monuments even of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Antiquity; ſo that the moſt polite Writers amongſt the Ancients, did light their Candles from this Sacred and ever burning Lamp. <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> borrowed out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> their Hiſtory of the Worlds Creation, which they improv'd, or rather debas'd by their Poetick Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Iapetus</hi> the Father of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and by whom the World was Re-peopled after the Flood, was no other but <hi>Japhet,</hi> whom the Poets feign'd to be the Son of <hi>Coelum</hi> and <hi>Terra;</hi> that is, to have had his Extraction from God. The <hi>Ogygian</hi> and <hi>Deucalion</hi> Floods were Poetick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions deriv'd from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deluge. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>

However ſo it was that they ſtill retain'd Circumciſion even long before they ever heard of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100786:97"/>
they embrac'd his Doctrine with leſs difficulty, as agreeing with them in that Cuſtom.

            <p>The Third general Argument to prove the Authority of the Old Teſtament, as alſo the Truth of the Jewiſh Religion, is drawn from the certainty of its Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For Inſtance, <hi>Jacob</hi> upon his Death bed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. in Bleſſing <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s two Sons, contrary to the order of their Birth-right; and as they were preſented to him by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> croſſing his Arms, lays
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100786:98"/>
his Right-hand upon the Head of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> the younger Brother, and gives him the Preeminence in his Bleſſings: Nor did he do this by chance, but by aſſiſted and ſteddy direction; for though he was decrepid and his Eyes dim, yet had he a clear foreſight of what was to come to paſs Six or Seven hundred years after his death, Propheſying the future Greatneſs of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which we find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified upon the Revolt of the Ten Tribes, of which <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the Head; for <hi>Jeroboam</hi> their firſt King was of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as alſo many of thoſe Kings who ſucceeded him, and <hi>Samaria</hi> the Metropolis, in which the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> reſided did belong alſo to <hi>Ephraim.</hi> To this we might add ſome other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of like certainty, which for as much as they reſpect the prefixt Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Period of the Jewiſh Government and Religion, come more properly to be conſider'd of in the following Chapter.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WE have in ſome meaſure ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of what Authority the Jewiſh Religion was, the juſt extent whereof will yet further appear, if we have regard a little to the Scope and End to which it was directed, <hi>viz.</hi> The Birth of the great Meſſiah, even Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of the World; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe let us a little conſider the Nature of thoſe Rites and Inſtitutions, of which the Jewiſh Religion did conſiſt. Their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Aſperſions, and other Luſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could in themſelves have no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to expiate Sins, and purifie the Souls of Men; if ſo, Sanctity might have been purchas'd at an eaſie rate. That vaſt Number of Offerings and Sacrifices ſmoaking always before the Temple, could hold no proportion with the State of Men, or with the Nature of God, who being a pure Spirit, and merciful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his Creatures, could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Blood of ſo many harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Animals, no more than the ſame
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100786:99"/>
Blood could cleanſe anothers Infirmities; and ſuch as were of a Spiritual Nature, indeed naturally they muſt ſeem to encreaſe the Stain, and to make the Guilt to be of a deeper Tincture.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe, let us imagine our ſelves to have been preſent at ſome of thoſe Solemnities. What Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can our Ears meet with in the doleful Bellowings of ſo many Beaſts of all kinds, then ready to be murder'd? What Spectacle of Horrour muſt it needs have been for our Eyes to behold ſuch a Prodigious Number of <hi>Levites</hi> truſs'd up to do Execution, wreeking their Hands in the Bowels of Beaſts, with their Knives dropping Blood, and their Frocks beſpatter'd with Gore, and polluted with Duſt, Sweat, and ſuch like Ordure as muſt attend ſuch a general Butchery? What Nidour muſt it be which muſt affect our Senſe of Smelling from the broyling of ſo much Fleſh on the Coals, and from the Steams and Fumes ariſing from an infinite Number of Pots and Spits, of Caldrons and Frying-Pans? inſomuch that all the Stalls, Shops and Chambers of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Buildings of the Temple (which muſt needs have been exceeding many) ſeem'd nothing but one monſtrous
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100786:99"/>
Theater of Blood, Shambles and Sculle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. To all which Heats ariſing from ſuch a vaſt Number of Fires, let us add thoſe of the ſcorching Climate, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Summer, which was the Seaſon appointed for theſe Solemnities, together with the Inconveniencies and Diſtempers, which muſt needs follow ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Throng of People, and we may eaſily imagine, that they were almoſt poiſon'd in all their Senſes, and that the noyſomneſs of the Offerings was as great as that of the Sins which occaſion'd them, and that ſuch a mixture and medly of things, ſo Diſpleaſing, Painful and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, was ſufficient to render all, both Actors and Spectators, but one great and dreadful Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>All theſe Circumſtances could not but affect ſuch as were Piouſly diſpos'd, with a deteſtation of their own ſinful Natures, for whoſe ſake they were Inſtituted; but much greater muſt their Horrour have been when once they apprehended, that all theſe Bloody Performances, were only as ſo many Types of that one Real and Tremendous Sacrifice, which was to be accompliſh'd in the dolorous Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Death of the Great and Innocent <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> God and Man, in his moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious and painful Sufferings upon the
<pb facs="tcp:100786:100"/>
Croſs. Doubtleſs God Almighty had reveal'd ſomething of this Nature, to ſome of the more devout and knowing Jews, though the Generality look'd no further than the viſible and external Rites, which could in no meaſure purge away Sin, but in Virtue of that Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate and Supernatural Victim, which was to endure for all Ages, and of which the Lamb of the Paſſover was a pregnant Symbol, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. No, no, theſe Sacrifices in themſelves could have no purging nor atoning Virtue, nor could they in their own Natures be acceptable to God: <hi>For thou delighteſt not in Sacrifice,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. <hi>elſe would I give it thee; thou delighteſt not in Burnt Offerings. The Sacrifices of God are a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit, a broken and a contrite heart.</hi> And upon this account it was, that Obedience was better than Sacrifice; and that we read ſo often of the Sacrifice of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Praiſe and Thankſgiving: Hence it was alſo, that the Circumciſion of Lips and Heart, that is, a purity of our Works, Thoughts and Affections, are ſo often preſs'd in Scripture. The Blood of Bulls and Goats could never <note place="margin">Hebr. 10</note> take away Sins, nor could their Sacrifices perfect the comers to them, for as much as they were only Shadows of good things to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100786:100"/>
come: all which, and many more Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of this Nature are preſs'd at large by St. <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the Bigots of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Laws; ſhewing alſo the true and legal Ceſſation of them upon the coming of Chriſt: which thing alſo was actually accompliſh'd, as appears by the State and Circumſtances of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation to this very day.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Sacrifices, let us proceed to their Predictions: the firſt ſhall be that of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Benediction of his Sons; where ſpeaking of <hi>Judah,</hi> he ſays, <hi>The Scepter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from between his Feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the Nations be,</hi> &amp;c. For the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of which Paſſage we are to note, that <hi>Shiloh</hi> was a Mountain where <note place="margin">Vide Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney du Pleſſis, cap. 29. de Veritat. Relig. Chriſt.</note> the Ark of the Tabernacle was kept, and where the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a long time went up to worſhip before the Temple was built: and <hi>Shiloh</hi> in this Senſe may ſignifie the Worſhip of God; tho the Grammatical ſignification of the Word is <hi>(who ſhall be ſent)</hi> and then the Senſe is this, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>until he come who ſhall be ſent;</hi> which even the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> In this Prediction
<pb facs="tcp:100786:101"/>
'tis plain, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was guided by the Spirit of God: For by the Courſe of Nature, <hi>Reuben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were before <hi>Judah.</hi> This Prediction alſo was made by <hi>Jacob</hi> 600. years before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power fell into the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> where it continued till the Captivity and afterwards: For <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> under whoſe Government the <hi>Jews</hi> were reſtor'd, was of the Lineage of <hi>David:</hi> But after it fell out, that the Regal Family, and the Prieſthood were united by Marriage, for want of Heirs Male in ſome one of the ruling Princes, the Government laps'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Family of the High Prieſt, in right of their Wives: for by a particular Privilege or Cuſtom, the Royal and the Levitical Tribes married frequently into one anothers Families, as appears by <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Records: And hence it was that the <note place="margin">Vide Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat. p 4.</note> 
               <hi>Maccabees,</hi> or <hi>Aſſamonean</hi> Family, who held the Prieſthood by Paternal deſcent, held alſo the Civil Power by a Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right; both which Powers were ſtill united in one Perſon, till the time of <hi>Herod,</hi> the Son of <hi>Antipater,</hi> who being an Alien, or Native of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> by the Power of the <hi>Romans</hi> obtained the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the better to ſtrengthen his Intereſt in the <hi>Jews,</hi> he became a I roſelyte, and married <hi>Mariamne,</hi> the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100786:101"/>
Daughter of <hi>Hircanus</hi> (then a Priſoner in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and the laſt Prince of the Race of the <hi>Maccabees;)</hi> whom he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward murder'd, together with his Wife and the Children he had by her, out of jealouſie, leaſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould reſtore ſome one or other of that Race to the Kingdom of their Anceſtors. He murdered alſo all the Illuſtrious Perſons of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> he burnt their Genealogies and Archives, and he kill'd their ſeventy Senators, or Judges, which made the Sanhedrim, ſubſtituting ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their place, and by theſe violent Proceedings put a period to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government, even as it was foretold ſix hundred Years before by <hi>Jacob:</hi> For in his Reign it was that Jeſus, the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah or Chriſt, was born: And not long after the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation was govern'd by Proconſuls, and ſoon after alſo, their City, Temple, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was utterly demoliſh'd by <hi>Titus.</hi> Now that Jeſus was the promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, ſhall be prov'd at large in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters: Nor can the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhew another Meſſiah, or Saviour, from the time their Government had its period to this very day; much leſs ſuch a one to whom the Nations were gather'd, as they were to Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100786:102"/>
Others there are, who by the Scepter <note place="margin">Monſaut. in Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> ſpoken of by <hi>Jacob,</hi> do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Davidical</hi> Monarchy; for this they ſay ended in <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: And as for <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> tho he was of the Line of <hi>David,</hi> yet his Power was not Regal and Hereditary, but rather Conſulary and Aſcititions; as being of chiefeſt note amongſt thoſe who return'd, and was a Favourite alſo of <hi>Darius.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> we read of <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias,</hi> that they exercis'd the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Authority in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government, tho it does not appear that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way related to <hi>Zorobabel</hi> by Blood or Affinity. As for the <hi>Aſſamonean</hi> Family, who govern'd as Princes and High Prieſts, that they were of the Lineage of <hi>David</hi> by the Mothers ſide, is aſſerted <hi>gratis,</hi> but not prov'd. By the Scepter then, they underſtand only the Political State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which in ſome Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or other, was to continue till the coming of the Meſſiah, and might be ſaid to be in <hi>Judah,</hi> foraſmuch as the greateſt part of the <hi>Jews</hi> were of that Tribe and Territory. But which way ſoever we interpret the Prophecy, we find it to have been accompliſh'd about the time of our Saviour's Birth; or at ſuch time as <hi>Herod</hi> invaded the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100786:102"/>
and extinguiſh'd all <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites whatſoever, as hath been before obſerved.</p>
            <p>The next famous Prediction is that of <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9. The Words are theſe: <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy City, to finiſh the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and to make an end of Sins, and to make Reconciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs, and to Seal up the Viſion and Prophecy, and to anoint the moſt Holy: Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandment, to reſtore and build Jeruſalem unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall be ſeven Weeks, and threeſcore and two Weeks, the Streets ſhall be built again, and the Wall, even in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous times: And after threeſcore and two Weeks ſhall Meſſiah be cut off; but not for himſelf: and the people of the Prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary; and the end thereof ſhall be with a Flood.</hi> There are two Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this famous Viſion which require a little explication: The firſt is the Word <hi>Week,</hi> or <hi>Hebdomas,</hi> which Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically ſignifies a Septenary Number, and is commonly taken for a Week, or Septenary of days; but ſometimes too for a Septenary, or Week of Years, as is obvious amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb facs="tcp:100786:103"/>
               <hi>Leviticus</hi> 25. we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count not only of a Septenary, or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Weeks, [where on the Seventh Week; that is, on the Seventh Year, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>(Sabbaticus)</hi> they were not to plough nor ſow, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> but we have an Account of ſeven Sabbaths, or ſeven Weeks of Years; which made in all Forty nine Years, and then begun their Jubilee, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Fiftieth Year, wherein Liberty was proclaimed to the Captive, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man was to be reſtored to his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and to return to his Family: in which Year alſo they were neither to ſow nor reap, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> In like manner <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. we read of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he could not obtain <hi>Rachel</hi> for his Wife, till ſuch time as he had fulfilled her Week; that is, his ſeven Years Service for her, as it is there expreſs'd at large. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this Paſſage of <hi>Daniel</hi> muſt be underſtood by weeks of Years, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by all Expoſitors; ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Abſurdities and Falſities would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhould we interpret the Prophecy by weeks of Days: For <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not built in ſeven Weeks, nor in many Years after the return of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Nor was there any Meſſiah who appeared and was put to death, after the ſpace of a Year and ſome Months; much leſs was
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100786:103"/>
the Temple profan'd in ſo ſhort a time; nor were there any ſuch Deſolations and Abominations as are there ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>The next Queſtion is, from what time we are to begin our Account. We muſt underſtand therefore that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Decrees made by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings in favour of the <hi>Jews;</hi> of which Two were more ſignal. The firſt was that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the firſt Year of his Reign, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Ezra, chap.</hi> 1. and this Decree was for the rebuilding the Temple. The other Decree is that which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſpeaks of in the Twentieth Year of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes Longimanus,</hi> call'd in Scripture <hi>[Ahaſuerus]</hi> for the rebuilding the City and Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This Decree of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> was in the Year of the World 3529. to which if we add ſeven Weeks of Years, or Forty nine Years to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd for the rebuilding of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſixty two weeks of Years, we ſhall find the number of Four hundred eighty three Years, and then the total Sum of Years will be 4012, which falls out within four or five Years that Chriſt the Meſſiah was crucified; and in Computations of this Nature it can hardly be imagin'd that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chronologiſt tho never ſo accurate, ſhould be able to reduce Tranſactions to a certain number of Years by a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb facs="tcp:100786:104"/>
Exactneſs. However, we find the accompliſhment of this Prediction touching the Meſſiah's death, to have hapned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the middle of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign; at which time 'twas that Chriſt was crucified. And as to the Abomination and perpetual Deſolation of the Temple and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which was ſhortly after to follow by a Prince of the People that was to come; all this was accompliſh'd by <hi>Titus,</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who in the time of this Prophecy were a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very inconſiderable, and unknown to the <hi>Perſians</hi> for ſome Ages after. And as for the Authority and Credit of this Prophecy, there is no place for Atheiſm to ſcruple at: For it was regiſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Canonical Books, in that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> made by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus,</hi> almoſt Three hundred Years before its Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſignal Token of the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation and Religion, is collected from that Paſſage in the <hi>33d</hi> of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where we read, that God had appointed all the Males to appear at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thrice in the Year, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Feaſt of Unleavened Bread, at the Feaſt of Weeks, or Firſt-fruits, and at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, or gathering of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100786:104"/>
Each of which Feaſts laſted ſeven days; during all which time of abſence, God promiſed, that their Lands and Houſes ſhould not be moleſted and ſpoil'd by their Neighbouring Nations<hi>:</hi> which in truth was a continual Miracle: For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of ſo many Hundred Years, we do not find they were ever injur'd by their Enemies, who doubtleſs would never have ſlipt ſo many advantages, had they not in a miraculous manner been withheld by God. But when the time prefixt to their Government was once expir'd, then 'twas that God ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Titus</hi> to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the time of the Paſſover, that there might be a more Univerſal and inevitable Deſtruction; which like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Flood (as it was foretold) ſwept them all away; for after that time they were abandon'd by God to utter Ruin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>

            <p>AND here it will not be unprofitable, how unpleaſant ſoever it may be, to fix our Thoughts a little upon this black and gloomy Scene, by conſidering the Severity and Righteouſneſs of God's Judgments upon this forlorn and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Nation, who are now as diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from all mankind beſides, by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Stream or Inundation rather of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as they were once by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Series of Deliverances and Mercies. Scarce had Thirty five Years paſt from the murder of the Righteous Jeſus, when <hi>Titus,</hi> by the command of his Father, inveſts <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on the very day of the Paſſover, which fell out to be the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> by all Lunary Computation; tho <hi>Joſephus</hi> makes it to have been on <note place="margin">Lib. 6. Bel. Jud. c. 4.</note> the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> The City with all its Fortreſſes was not taken till the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following: during which time of the Siege, there dyed by Famine and other Diſeaſes 715080. beſides a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which fled daily, or were turn'd out of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100786:105"/>
the Gates to eaſe the beſieged: all which were tortured and crucified in ſight of their Walls. The Number of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners amounted to 97000. and thoſe who dyed by the Sword, Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in the whole 1100000. A thing which to us may ſeem incredible, how ſo much Proviſion could be found for the maintenance of ſo many Souls; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were, that they had laid in greater Stores than what was uſual for the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Feaſt, upon a Proſpect of the Deſign of <hi>Titus,</hi> and that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confided to their Walls than to the open Campaign, upon an Erroneous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief poſſibly, that God would never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be demoliſh'd a ſecond time: However it was, the Miſeries they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd muſt be without Parallel, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vaſt Multitudes which were crowded up together, and the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a ſcorching Seaſon; which (beſides the ſlaughter made on them by the Enemy,) did direly afflict them by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence and Famine.</p>
            <p>In ſhort; their City and Temple, and all Records of their Nation were reduc'd to Aſhes: Their Prieſts and Rulers utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy'd, and thoſe few that remain'd were loaded with Opprobry and Miſery; ſcatter'd hither and thither, and never
<pb facs="tcp:100786:106"/>
ſuffer'd to return to their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to this very day. And if at any time in after Ages they grew into a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they were preſently maſſacred as an Execrable Race, and unfit to live upon the Earth. From that time to this, they have had neither Temple, Sacrifice, nor Prieſts; and let the Jews lye as they pleaſe, 'tis certain, that all Proofs of their Deſcents and Tribes are loſt; all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Records of their Genealogies periſh'd in the Flames, they themſelves being ſtill toſs'd about the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to perpetual Wants and Fears, and not in the leaſt addicted to Learning, and to preſerve the Memory of their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes by writing of Hiſtories; or if they were, is it poſſible, being ſo divided and ſcatter'd, as they are, and rowling from Place to Place, that they ſhould give any account of their Lineage or paſt Tranſactions? ſo that we of this Age might with far greater eaſe pretend to tell of what Family and Profeſſion every Man's Anceſtors were of Twelve or thirteen hundred years ago; which if any living dares venture to do I am much miſtaken: much more impoſſible then muſt this be, for ſo many individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in ſuch Circumſtances as thoſe the Jews lie under, to give a Hiſtory or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100786:106"/>
of their Families and Pedigree; who though they be blown and ſcatter'd into all Corners of the Earth, yet have they no footing in it, having no City of their own, no Magiſtrates nor Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature: Nor are they ſuffer'd to purchaſe a yard of Land any where amongſt the Chriſtians. And as for what's reported of their inhabiting ſome Mountains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or elſewhere, under a Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their own, it is without colour of Truth, and utterly inconſiſtent with the Turkiſh Maxims. And as they have no Propriety in the Earth, ſo have they but a precarious Right even to the Waters; for whatſoever Traffick they drive at Sea, they are not ſuffer'd to have a Ship of their own, but are forc'd to venture all in Chriſtian or Turkiſh Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and under the covert of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants their profeſt Enemies, for fear of Repriſals and Forfeitures. Their Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities make them induſtrious and ſubtil, and have taught them all the Arts of ſhifting and cheating, which renders them moſt odious: And even thoſe States who admit of them, do it out of Policy, placing them many times over their Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Cuſtoms, as the fitteſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Exaction, and who know all the ſordid and deteſtable ways of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations,
<pb facs="tcp:100786:107"/>
and of ſcrewing the Strings to the height. Where they are permitted to live publickly, though their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be pretended, 'tis nothing leſs: For if a Jew become a Chriſtian, his Goods are forfeited, upon pretence of being got by Uſury and unjuſt Practices; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a notable Argument to perſwade them to become Chriſtians: 'Tis ſuch a piece of Policy certainly as cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Maxims of true Chriſtianity, no more than it can conſiſt with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Honeſty, to ſuffer them to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the People amongſt whom they live, by their many Cheats, and by their intolerable Uſuries and Brokeage, whilſt they pay perhaps ſome ſhare of their Ill-gotten Wealth to the Government in a way of Compoſition, for their Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Privileges; ſo that in effect, they are us'd only as Spunges to ſuck the Radical Moiſture of the People, which may be ſqueez'd out of them again at Pleaſure; in which Caſe 'tis hard to judge whether are the greater Jews, they or ſuch Chriſtians. And yet for all this, they are held in the ſame diſtruſt with Thieves and Murderers, being lockt and chain'd up every night within their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Quarters.</p>

Such ſevere uſage cannot but fill them with diſmal Reſentments; and hence it is, that they are the greateſt Maſters in the Helliſh Arts of Poiſoning, and the moſt refin'd Inſtruments of ſecret Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Treachery, and prone to all manner of Villainy. Notwithſtanding that their Religion does require them to abſtain from Blood, it would be both their Meat and Drink too, had they the Power in their hands. Notwithſtanding their Religion does for the moſt part conſiſt in Forms of Purifying, in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Apparel, in frequent Waſhings, and abſtaining from all Pollutions of Meat and Ordure, yet are they the moſt noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Creatures in the Univerſe, more unclean and naſty than the Swine they loath, and diſtinguiſhable from all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by their rank and abominable Smells. Their Habitations, generally ſpeaking, are like ſo many Styes of Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers; and their very Synagogues (the only Places of that little Worſhip and Religion they profeſs) do ſtink even to a Proverb. In a word, like the Progeny of <hi>Cain,</hi> they are kept alive only to wander about the Earth, with Marks of Guilt and Terrour, and with which they have been branded ever ſince the Murder

of the Righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> the great Shepherd, whoſe Offering was more acceptable to God; that Hiſtory being a pregnant Type of the Jews and Chriſt; and for this purpoſe, let us Conſider ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances which attended that doleful Tragedy.</p>
            <p>The Jews, in the Crucifixion of the Bleſſed Jeſus, made Cruelty to be a thing of Paſtime and Recreation. They made a mock King of him, and after they had expos'd him to all deriſion and ſcorn, they wallow'd in his Blood, and ſported at his bitter Anguiſh and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. This indeed was the moſt mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectacle the Sun ever beheld; nay, behold it it could not, for 'twas then E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips'd, which Eclipſe was Miraculous and Supernatural, for as much as the Moon, at the time of our Saviour's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was not in Conjunction, but in Oppoſition to the Sun, or at the Full.

               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:100786:108"/>
an obſcure Fellow, whom they dreſs'd up in Royal Robes, after the Jewiſh Garb to adorn the Pageantry, and then treated him with all manner of inſult and ſcorn. At the ſame time alſo it was, that ſome of the Jews were Whipt and others Crucified. The Jews began their Paſſover with the Blood of the Meſſiah, who was the Paſchal Lamb indeed; and on that very day did they begin to require his Blood at their Hands, and to uſher in the Feaſt, by making them the Sacrifice. Again, the Death which was inflicted on the Meſſiah was Crucifixion; the ſame did <hi>Titus</hi> retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on the half famiſh'd Jews, who fled out of the City to the Number of Five hundred, daily, till at length there were not ſufficient Croſſes for Bodies, nor ſpace for Croſſes. In the laſt Place, the Jews pretended they had no other King but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that what they did was to prevent the <hi>Romans</hi> from taking away their Government; juſt therefore was it, that thoſe very <hi>Romans</hi> whom they thought to flatter by ſuch a deteſtable Parricide, ſhould revenge their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery by taking away their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Now that the People whom God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly delighted in, and which were engag'd to him by ſo many Mercies, and he to them by ſo many Promiſes, ſhould fall under ſuch an univerſal and perpetual Dereliction, as never happned to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People of the Earth to any degree, could not but proceed from ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and moſt execrable Crime; ſo that God do's now ſhew as great a Miracle, in not ſuffering the Jews to be ruin'd, and ſo to be deliver'd from their Miſery, as he did formerly in delivering them from their Enemies, and in defending them, though a little and inconſiderable Nation, amongſt ſo many Potent Governments which ſurrounded them; all which Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are the dreadful Effects of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inexpiable Murder; and of that dire Imprecation of theirs, <hi>Let his Blood be upon us and our Children.</hi>

            <p>HAving hitherto prov'd the Period of the Jewiſh Religion, not only in its cauſes and the certainty of its Predictions, but alſo in its effects and conſequences, it follows in the next place, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Chriſtian Religion: Now that this, and this only is the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the ordinary way by which the Will of God is now made known to Men, and by which we may attain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is demonſtrable from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Author, who was Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> The Divine Authority of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and his being the promiſed Meſſiah or Saviour of the World, ſhall be prov'd from theſe Three General Arguments. The Firſt is taken from the Types and Prophecies concerning the Meſſiah, and their accompliſhment in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. The Second General Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is taken from the Hiſtory of his Life, Doctrine and Miracles; to which may be added the Teſtimonies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions even of the Adverſaries of our Religion. The Laſt Argument is taken from the wonderful Effects which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:100786:110"/>
the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, being no leſs than the Converſion of the World.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Prophecies. As to the time of the Meſſiah's Birth, it was to commence upon the diſſolution of the Jewiſh Government, as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn in the precedent Chapter; which Period hapned about the Time of Jeſus Chriſt's appearance, as hath been prov'd already alſo. Next, for the place of his Birth, it was to be in <hi>Bethlehem Judah,</hi> according to the unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Jewiſh <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> upon the inquiry made by <hi>Herod,</hi> and which was occaſion'd by the <hi>Magi,</hi> who came to Worſhip Jeſus. This the Jewiſh Prieſts and Scribes prov'd from that Prophecy of <hi>Micah,</hi> chap. 5. where we read, <hi>But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle amongſt the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler</hi> in <hi>Iſrael; whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from Everlaſting.</hi> This Prediction we find actually accompliſh'd in the Birth of Jeſus <hi>(Luke</hi> the 2.) where we read, that Jeſus was born in <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> and in the days of <hi>Herod,</hi> &amp;c. in which Prophecy we have an Account not only of Chriſt's Human Nature in the Hiſtory of his Birth, but alſo of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100786:110"/>
his Divine Nature, in his <hi>goings forth which have been from of old, from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</hi> Amongſt the things that were foretold of the Manifeſtation of Jeſus, there is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That he was to have his Meſſenger or Fore-runner, who was to make Proclamation of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which is deſcrib'd by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to be the Voice of him <hi>that crieth in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. c. 40.</note> 
               <hi>prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtreight in the Deſart, a High-way for our God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all Fleſh ſhall ſee it.</hi> This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription we find to be verified of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> by his own Anſwer which he gave to the Jews; for when they ask'd him who he was; he told them that he was the <hi>Voice of one crying in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1.</note> 
               <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſpoken of by Iſaiah; and that there was one amongſt them, who coming after me is preferred before me: And the next day ſeeing Jeſus coming to him, he cried out, Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the world. This is he of whom I ſaid, after me cometh a man who is preferr'd before me, and I knew him not.</hi> In which Paſſage we have many Noble Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Nature and Offices of the Meſſiah; as Firſt, his Sacerdotal Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:100786:111"/>
in his being the true Paſchal Lamb to purge the Sins of the World, and of which the Jewiſh Paſſover was but a Type. In the next Place, we have an account of his Divine Nature; for <hi>John</hi> look'd upon himſelf to be but as his Shadow, Chriſt as the Subſtance: <hi>John</hi> was the Voice only of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, which ſort of People we know are of a ſervile and much inferiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to thoſe by whom they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd; and yet <hi>John</hi> was by Chriſt himſelf accounted the greateſt of all the Prophets; which thing appears from his Miraculous Birth, as alſo from his Auſtere and Exemplary Life; for which Reaſon he was called <hi>Elias</hi> by Chriſt, and was foretold by <hi>Malachi.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Malac. c. 3.</note> Thirdly, from his Excellent Doctrine, Preaching Repentance and Amendment of Life to all ſorts of People, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them by Baptiſm: And Laſtly, from his Integrity, Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in reproving <hi>Herod</hi> for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, for which he deſerv'd a Crown of Martyrdom. To all which we may add the Teſtimony of the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who all of them held <hi>John</hi> in the higheſt Veneration of Sanctity; in ſo much that <hi>Joſephus</hi> attributed the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes <note place="margin">Joſeph. lib. 18. c. 7.</note>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:100786:111"/>
and Over-throw of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Army to the Murder of this Saint. Now if this great Saint was but as a Voice, or a poor tranſitory thing, which vaniſhes in a Moment, in reſpect of Chriſt, Chriſt certainly muſt be more than a Man. And if we conſider the Circumſtances of this interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> we have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matter of wonder: For though they were near of Kin, and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, yet had they no knowledge of one another before, which ſhews that they liv'd in great Solitude and Retreat before they enter'd upon their Functions: Neither did they take the leaſt notice of their Conſanguinity, but entertain'd one another with Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a ſublimer Nature.</p>
            <p>From the Time, Place, and other Circumſtances of the Birth of Chriſt, let us proceed to conſider his Perſon and Offices; and this we have amply deſcrib'd by <hi>Iſaiah: For unto us a Child</hi>

               <hi>is born, unto us a Son is given;</hi> Here is his human Nature, <hi>and the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulders, and his name ſhall be call'd Wonderful Counſellour, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace:</hi> here is his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb facs="tcp:100786:112"/>
               <hi>Of the encreaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no End. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Throne of David, and upon his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with Juſtice from hence forth even for ever.</hi> Here we have his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the Perpetuity of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which could not be Temporal, ſince the Jews cannot ſhew any ſuch Prince, whoſe Government had no End: It remains therefore, that his Kingdom was Spiritual, and ſuch a one it was that Chriſt was inveſted with, as is evident to all the World: This we have more amply deſcrib'd by the ſame Prophet, by the Rod out of the Stem of <hi>Jeſſe, and that the Spirit of the Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. c. 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and of Might, the Spirit of Knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt's Prophetick Office, as alſo that of his Mediator-ſhip was fore-told by <hi>Moſes. A Prophet ſhall the Lord thy God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> 
               <hi>raiſe up unto thee, from the midſt of thee, like unto me, unto him ſhall ye hearken, according to all that thou didſt deſire of the Lord thy God in Horeb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> When the People ſeeing and hearing the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightnings, entreated <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:100786:112"/>
to ſpeak unto them, and not God, leaſt they ſhould be conſum'd by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Majeſty of his appearance. That the Jews were in a conſtant expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Prophet ſpoken of by <hi>Moſes,</hi> appears from the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>John, whether he were that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet?</hi> Now that Chriſt was the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of a Second Covenant, diſtinct from that which was made upon <hi>Mount Horeb</hi> and <hi>Sinah,</hi> is taught every where through the Goſpel. His Dominion and Regal Pomp in his Triumphant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on an Aſs, is pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually deſcrib'd by <hi>Zachary, Rejoyce</hi>

               <hi>greatly O Daughter of Zion, ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem: Behold thy King cometh unto thee; He is juſt and having Salvation, lowly and riding upon an Aſs, and upon a Colt, the Foal of an Aſs;</hi> and a little after; <hi>He ſhall ſpeak Peace unto the Heathen, and his Dominion ſhall be from Sea even to Sea, and from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver even to the ends of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Nature of Chriſt's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Offices, we are come in the laſt place to conſider of his great Sacerdotal Function in his Paſſion, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Merits of his Death: all this we have moſt accurately and pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <hi>hath no Form nor Comelineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no Beauty that we ſhould deſire him: He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows; ſurely he hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows: Yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities: The chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon him; and with his Stripes are we healed; the Lord hath laid upon him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> And a little after we find him brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter <hi>and that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his mouth.

Alſo he deſcribes the amplitude of the Church moſt elegantly, ſaying, <hi>Enlarge the place of thy Tent, and let them ſtretch forth the Curtains of thine Habitations; ſpare not, lengthen thy Cords, and ſtrengthen thy Stakes; for thou ſhalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy Seed ſhall inherit the Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> and then tells the reaſon: <hi>For thy Maker is thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name; and</hi>

               <hi>thy Redeemer the holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To enumerate all the Paſſages of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets upon this ſublime Subject, would be upon the matter to tranſcribe their Books. Let us haſten forwards then, and glance a little upon the Types of Chriſt, as they are ſhadow'd out to us in the Acts and Monuments of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory. <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus</hi> [for they are the ſame, and ſignifie a Deliverer or Saviour] was he who ſubdued the Enemies of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and brought them into the Land of Promiſe and of reſt: A Type of Jeſus, who was the Saviour both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> who overcame their Spiritual Enemies, and brought them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into the Land of Reſt, even the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. Thoſe diſobedient <hi>Jews</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Numb. 21.</note> in the Wilderneſs, who were bit by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, by looking on the brazen Serpent that was upon the Poſt, were healed. This Hiſtory repreſented the lifting up of Jeſus upon the Croſs; where ſuch as behold him by Faith are cured of thoſe Wounds, by which the old Serpent the Devil ſeeks to deſtroy us in our way to <hi>Canaan.</hi> The Red Cow without Spot or Blemiſh, which was to be burnt without
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100786:114"/>
the Camp, whoſe Blood was to be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and whoſe Aſhes were to be kept for a Purgation for Sin, was alſo a Type of Chriſt, whoſe Blood purifyeth for ſin, and <hi>who alſo ſuffered without the Gate.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Numb. 19. Heb. 13.</note> The Scape Goat which was carried away into the Wilderneſs with the Sins of the People upon his Head, was a Figure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Chriſt: But above all, the Paſchal Lamb, at the ſight of whoſe Blood the deſtroying Angel was made to ſpare the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was a compleat Type of Chriſt our Paſſover, who in the time and place of the Paſchal Lamb was offered for us.</p>
            <p>Now ſince all theſe Types and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols could not have any Power or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in their own Natures to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the guilt of Sins; it is apparent, that they were only Signs of Spiritual Gifts, and ſuch as were accompliſh'd in Chriſt, as the Scripture fully witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Neither let it ſeem abſurd that God ſhould figure ſuch ſublime Myſteries by contemptible and low things: For had he made uſe of nobler Types, there might have been ſome danger, that the Figure or Type might have been miſtaken for the thing figur'd: as if in
<pb facs="tcp:100786:115"/>
the place of a Lamb or Goat had ſome Illuſtrious Perſon, and of great Sanctity been offer'd, in progreſs of time ſuch a Type or Perſon would have been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the very Mediator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; whereas God thought it better to repreſent theſe Myſteries by ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common Creatures, as all Men could not but look upon as Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, holding no other Similitude with the thing ſignified, than as they were without Spot and Blemiſh, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of dying.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>The Objections of the Jews Anſwered.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TIs now high Time, to ſee what Ground the Jews have for their Belief, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt be a Temporal Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſuch a one as ſhould gather together all the Scatter'd Members of that Nation, and unite them into a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and reſettle them in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſubdue the World under him, as did <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> That which ſeems moſt to Countenance this Belief, is grounded upon that Paſſage of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <note place="margin">Iſaiah cap. 11.</note> where by the conſent both of Jews and Chriſtians, the Rod or Root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> there Deſcribed, is no other then the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah who ſhall ſtand for an Enſign to the People, and whom the Gentiles ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that Day, that the Lord ſhall ſet his Hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſecond Time, to recover the Remnant of his People which ſhall be left, from</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and from</hi> Egypt, <hi>and from</hi> Pathros, <hi>and from</hi> Cuſh, <hi>(or</hi> Ethiopia,) <hi>and from</hi> Elam, <hi>and from</hi> Shinar, <hi>and from</hi> Hamath, <hi>and from the Iſlands of the Sea. And he ſhall ſet up an Enſign againſt the Nations,</hi> (as the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100786:116"/>
reads it) <hi>and gather together the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed of</hi> Judah <hi>from the four Corners of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. And afterwards he tells us, That <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be reconcil'd and deſtroy their Enemies, the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Moabites, Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> together with the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and that <hi>Nilus</hi> ſhall be ſmitten in its ſeven Streams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer: Firſt, That the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings here Mention'd, have no Relation to ſuch a Temporal Deliverance as the Jews dream'd off, but to that Spiritual Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they ſhall meet with in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Converſion to Chriſt before the end of the World. This is plain by the whole Account we have of this Matter from the Context; for Verſes <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> of this Chap. 'tis ſaid, <hi>That he ſhall ſmite the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth, and with the Breath of his Lips ſhall he ſlay the Wicked. That Righteouſneſs ſhall be the Girdle of his Loins, and Faithfulneſs ſhall be the Girdle</hi> or Belt <hi>of his Reins.</hi> So here we ſee. That his Weapons are all Doctrinal and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; Nor is he deſcrlb'd by his Chariots and Horſemen, by his Bows and Spears, but by his Wiſdom in underſtanding the Will of God; by his Integrity in Judgment, and by his Condeſcenſion to the Meek and Poor. And that he ſhould not be uſher'd in with
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100786:116"/>
the loud Allarms of War, but with the ſweet Fruits of an Univerſal Peace; ſo that all the Beaſts of the Field, both the Tame and thoſe of Prey, ſhould live and feed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Moreover, he foretells, <hi>verſ.</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> That his Reſt or Sepulchre ſhall be Glorious; which paſſage cannot be applied to any, but to Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> in the circumſtance of his moſt Glorious and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Reſurrection. As for that Paſſage, that he ſhould Erect his Enſign or Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard againſt the Gentiles, 'twas moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verified of Jeſus, who ſet up his Sign, even that victorious one of the Croſs, by which he overcame the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and which will be ſtill Triumphant even to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>In the next place, As this Dominion of the promiſed Meſſiah was Spiritual, ſo the Bleſſings of it were to extend to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which could not be, were he to have been ſuch a ſecular Conquerer as the Jews dreamed off; for the Gentiles then would have been his Slaves and Captives; whereas by the account of the Prophets, they were to bear a part in the Jubile and in the Benefits of his Government; whence it was that the ſame Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> burſt out into a Rapture, Crying, <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſaiah cap. 60.</note> 
               <hi>is riſen upon thee.</hi> (verſ. 3.) <hi>The Gentiles</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:100786:117"/>
               <hi>ſhall come to thy Light, and Kings to the Brightneſs of thy Riſing.</hi> Moreover, the ſame Prophet amongſt other Deſcriptions which he gives of the Meſſiah, ſays, that he ſhall be a <hi>Light for the Gentiles;</hi> which Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <note place="margin">Iſaiah cap. 42.</note> occurs in many other Paſſages of the Prophets. Now 'tis known to all, that the Uſe and Benefit of a Light, is not to conſume, but to direct Men in the way, and to ſecure them from Erring, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Danger. To all which we may add, the Prediction of <hi>Jacob</hi> in his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Judah,</hi> where he ſays of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>the expectation of the Gentiles. Zachary</hi> when he invites the Daughters of <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſhout <note place="margin">Zach. cap. 9.</note> for Joy, deſcribes the Triumphant Entrance of their King, or the Meſſiah by his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riding upon an Aſs, and by his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace to the Gentiles, and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Dominions even from Sea to Sea, and to the utmoſt ends of the Earth: None of which Deſcriptions can ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to any Temporal Prince of the Jews, much leſs to ſuch a Meſſiah as they dream off, who was to Triumph by Deeds of War over the Heathen; whereas the Meſſiah there deſcrib'd, was to win them to his Government by the ſweet Charms of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:100786:117"/>
In the laſt place, the Imagination of the Jews, that the Meſſiah ſhould be a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prince, is utterly inconſiſtent with the grand Scope of the Scriptures, which teach us every where to forſake the World with all the Pomps and Vanities thereof, and not to build our Happineſs on Temporal Enjoyments. Beſides, the Promiſe of the Meſſiah was a thing of Joy: <hi>Be joyfull O Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>ſhout O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>clap your Hands, and ſhout as in a Jubile,</hi> are the uſual Forms which uſher in the News of the Meſſiah. Now were he to have been a Prince of Grandure, what matter of Joy could it have been to a poor Jew to think, that many Ages after he was dead and forgotten, there ſhould ſome mighty <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ariſe in his Country, who ſhould do Wonders? Juſt as much comfort as it would be to me, were I in Wants and Miſery, and complaining of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſome Reverend and Learned Doctor, inſtead of relieving my Neceſſities, he ſhould tell me, Friend, be of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and leap for Joy; for about 2000 Years hence and better, their ſhall ariſe a high and mighty King in <hi>England,</hi> who ſhall Conquer all the Nations round about him, and his Subjects ſhall live in great Peace and Plenty: Such a thought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would be ſo far from eaſing my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100786:118"/>
Unhappineſs, that it would rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it; when I ſhould think ſeriouſly of ſuch remote Contents, and ſuch as I ſhould never taſte of; and yet this is the Caſe of the Unbelieving, or rather of the All-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews, who after the diſappointments and calamities of ſo many Ages, are as earneſt as ever in the Expectation of their Meſſiah. But the Benefits of the Meſſiah being Spiritual, (as is taught by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,) they are Communicable to Men through all Ages of the World, and can reach the remoteſt Nations; which indeed, was no other then what was foretold by the Prophets, nor is this belief attended with any difficulties whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that many of theſe Prophetick Paſſages ſeem to have alluſion to good King <hi>Joſias,</hi> (who enter'd upon his Kingdom when he was a Child,) as alſo to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Deliverance of the Jews from under the Babyloniſh Captivity. But ſtill 'tis true, and allow'd even by the Jews themſelves, that they had a much farther proſpect, even to a greater Deliverance: For neither could <hi>Joſias,</hi> nor <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> nor any of the Jewiſh Worthies be call'd Deliverers. God knows, they were poor Supplicants, and depended wholly upon the Indulgence of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But the Crcumſtance of the Gentiles being to be made partakers of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100786:118"/>
theſe Bleſſings, extends the Benefits of theſe Propheſies infinitely beyond the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Jewiſh Nation, who were ever after but a poor ſcattered and precarious People.</p>
            <p>As to the Authority of theſe and many ſuch like Propheſies, even Atheiſm it ſelf cannot queſtion it; unleſs we ſay, That the Jews after the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt, did ſtuff the Old Teſtament with ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Paſſages as made againſt themſelves and their Religion. Beſides, all theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages being found in the Tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and conſidering alſo with what exactneſs the Jews kept theſe ſacred Copies, even to numbring the very Letters, how negligent ſoever they were in obſerving the Commandments of the Law; 'tis ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible ſuch Paſſages ſhould be foiſted in without their knowledge, as it is impoſſible that ſuch certain and punctual Predictions ſhould proceed from any other Mouth, but that of Almighty God; and this I take to be an Argument, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and ſuch as might convince even <hi>Porphyry</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were he now alive. And ſo I have done with the Old Teſtament.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BUt beſides the Propheſies recorded in Sacred Writings; we have other Predictions alſo out of proſane Monuments, which though of an inferiour Authority, are very appoſite to prove the Verity of Chriſt's Meſſiah-ſhip. All the Hiſtories of the Age wherein Chriſt was Born, doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that both <hi>Herod,</hi> as alſo the Jews, were in preſent Expectation of the Meſſiah. Hence it was, that <hi>Herod</hi> who yielded up himſelf to the flatteries of his Followers, was eaſily perſuaded to think that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the promiſed Meſſiah; and thoſe who adhered to this Belief, were in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called <hi>Herodians,</hi> as is conjectur'd: For the Jews finding <hi>Herod</hi> to be a King of great Power, and who rebuilt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo after a moſt magnificent Form; they preſently concluded that this was he who was to reſtore their State and Empire. And <hi>Herod</hi> too was not wanting to himſelf to improve ſuch favourable overtures; upon which account it was, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many Murders even on his own
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100786:119"/>
Children alſo, hoping in the general Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre to extinguiſh the true Meſſiah where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tell us; we read <note place="margin">Joſ. de lib. Jud. l. 7. c. 7.</note> alſo in <hi>Suetonius,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> how it was the Belief of many in that Age, that in the Sacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the Prieſt was regiſtred, that out of <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould come forth thoſe who were to govern the World, which was <note place="margin">Tacit l. 5.

            </p>
            <p>But above all, Thoſe famous Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Sybills</hi> are a compleat evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Truth. <hi>Tully</hi> whilſt he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours <note place="margin">Tul. lib. 2. de Divin.</note> to evacuate the Credit of theſe Propheſies, reports this Paſſage out of them: <hi>That he who was indeed to be our King, was to be called alſo a King in Caſe we would obtain Salvation.</hi> This Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was contain'd in the initial Letters of ſome Verſes; which for this reaſon alſo, were called <hi>Acroſticks,</hi> telling us withall, that the Propheſies of the <hi>Sybills</hi> were lockt up, and were not to be inſpected, but by order of the Senate; foraſmuch as they ſeem rather to contribute to the Subverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then to the Conſervation of Religion, there being nothing more odious to the <hi>Romans</hi> than the thing called <hi>[King]</hi> which was legible throughout theſe Sacred Books.

            </head>
            <p>THe ſecond General Argument by which we have propos'd to prove the Truth of Chriſt's Meſſiah-ſhip, is taken from his Doctrine; as alſo from the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Life and Miracles, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us in the Writings of the New Teſtament. Now in theſe Writings there are two things to be conſider'd; firſt, their Authors, ſecondly, their Authority. To prove their Authors, we have no other way but by humane Authorities; but yet ſuch too as are ſtrengthen'd by all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Reaſon: For if it were raſhneſs unpardonable to queſtion the Truth of <hi>Caeſars</hi> conquering <hi>Britain,</hi> or of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating <hi>Pompey,</hi> and of his being Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Senate; for as much as the Books which report theſe things, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd to be the Genuine works of thoſe who liv'd in the ſame Age, whoſe names alſo are prefix'd to them, tis certainly much greater madneſs to doubt, that the Books of the New Teſtament were writ by the Apoſtles, ſince we find a more univerſal and uninterrupted belief hereof in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100786:121"/>
Voices of an Infinite number of learned Men from Age to Age, even to the very times theſe Sacred Authors flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd; and this is that which we call the Authority of the Church, or univerſal Tradition.</p>
            <p>The other Point reſpects the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Writings. That they have tranſmitted to Poſterity a true Hiſtory of Jeſus, and were Divinely inſpir'd, appears from the near Relation they had to Chriſt in being inſtructed by him; ſo that they could neither deceive or be deceiv'd: For the ſame Arguments which prove the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah-ſhip and Divine Gift of Jeſus, prove the Teſtimonies of thoſe to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd his Doctrine, to be convincing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Now here comes in a Point about which Papiſts and Proteſtants raiſe a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> How the Authority of the Apoſtles Writings, call'd the Word of God, can depend upon Tradition, which is an Inferiour kind of Authority. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this point, we are carefully to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the Authority of a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Authority of a Judge. The former is only Miniſterial, Declaratory, and converſant about matter of Fact; the other is Magiſterial and Legiſlative, and may concern matters of Faith; that is, ſuch Divine Truths, as are many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100786:122"/>
our Natural Reaſon to underſtand. Now that Divine Truths, as to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, ſhould depend upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Teſtimony of the Church, is not at all abſurd; but very conſonant to Reaſon, which in Scripture Phraſe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Evidence or Reaſon of our Belief or Hope: But then Evidence once made, we are requir'd to yield an implicit kind of aſſent to the Doctrines of Scripture, upon the account of the Divine Authority and veracity of their Author, as being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Legiſlator, and upon that ſcore to be believed in whatſoever he ſaies, though never ſo difficult to our Wills and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; and this is called Faith. Let us illuſtrate this Point a little; For inſtance, The King ſends his Letters Mandatory by his Meſſenger, or ſome other perſon of Credit and Reputation; Upon the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we have of the Credit and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Meſſenger, we receive ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as Royal Mandates, with a ſuitable Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and then without more adoe, we yield, or ought to yield Obedience to them in the ſame manner, as if his Royal Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty were preſent in Perſon to enjoin the Contents. Here 'tis plain, we make a difference betwixt the Authority of the Teſtimony or Meſſenger, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Prince; and yet we ſhould not
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100786:122"/>
eaſily ſubmit to theſe Letters, were they not atteſted by ſuch credible means; for ſhould we find ſuch Letters in the Streets, or High-ways, though never ſo Patent, and Sign'd and Seal'd with all Formalities Imaginable, we ſhould not take much Notice of them, much leſs be oblig'd to pay our Obedience to them; ſo that here we ſee, how the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Aſſent are one thing, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Aſſent is another, and of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nature, though depending on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Having clear'd the way to the reaſon of our Belief, let us now Conſider the Scope and Contents of the New Teſtament, and we ſhall find them to be either Doctrinal, or Hiſtorical. The Doctrinals are ſuch as are Converſant about matters of Belief, or matters of Practiſe. We ſhall begin with matters of Belief, the grand Scope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſeems to level at this one Fundamental Point; that Jeſus is the Chriſt, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah: This, as it hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prov'd from the Propheſies of the Old Teſtament, let us now proceed to prove alſo by the actual Offices of a Meſſiah or Redeemer. A Redeemer is one who pays a Debt for another, and ſets him at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and properly it has reſpect to Slaves or Men Impriſon'd, who are unable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſatisfie their Creditors, or thoſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100786:123"/>
to whom they are in Bondage. Now Chriſt as the Redeemer of Mankind, being a Publick Repreſentative, was under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Obligation; firſt, of fulfilling the Law or Commands of God himſelf, and this is call'd active Obedience; ſecondly, of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying or ſuffering for the breach of it, and this is call'd Paſſive Obedience.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's Active Obedience, or his fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, appears ſeveral ways, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moral Law Chriſt fulfill'd it in his ſtrict Obſervance of it; but eſpecially in his more perfect Interpretation of it, by ſhewing its true, full and genuine Senſe, which indeed is the Soul of every Law. The Jews look'd only to the outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance or ſhell of the Law, whereas Chriſt had regard to the inward bent of the Soul, and to the Affections. The Law ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God;</hi> Chriſt ſaies, <hi>Thou ſhalt love him with all thy heart, and with all thy ſtrength;</hi> The Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in Vain;</hi> Chriſt goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> The Law ſaies, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> Chriſt ſaies, <hi>Whoſoever is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his Brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of Judgment,</hi> and that whoſoever <hi>looketh on a Woman with a luſtfull thought, committeth Adultery in his Heart.</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100786:123"/>
firbids not onely all falſe Teſtimonies, but even all idle Works. Then for the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law, it was <hi>Lex Talionis;</hi> an Eye for an Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt ſays, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right Cheek, turn to him the left alſo.</hi> The Law ſaid, Love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy; Chriſt ſays, <hi>Love your Enemies, and bleſs them that curſe you.</hi> Alſo for Alms, Prayer and Faſting, he improves theſe Duties to an higher degree of Perfection, than that under the Jewiſh Ordinances. As for the Ceremonial Law, 'tis known that Chriſt was in all things conformable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; he was circumcis'd, and was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Temple, and he obſerv'd their Feaſts. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But beſides all this, he fulfill'd theſe Laws in another Senſe, in as much as they were accompliſh'd in him; for all the Rites and Sacrifices under the Jewiſh Law with all their Types, (as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed,) were Figures onely of Chriſt. Now the Figure or Shadow vaniſhes when the ſubſtance comes in place; all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ceas'd upon the appearance of Chriſt, as in the preſence of a Prince the Office of an Ambaſſadour ceaſes: For from the time of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was the laſt Prophet, and by his preaching Repentance, uſher'd in the Bleſſed Jeſus, the Jews never had a Prophet more; a clear proof that he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100786:124"/>
was the Meſſiah of whom they all writ.</p>
            <p>The other Obligation under which Chriſt lay to the Law, was that of his Paſſive Obedience, in ſuffering the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the Tranſgreſſion of it. <hi>He poured out his Soul unto Death, and bare the ſins of many.</hi> And ſo under theſe two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities <note place="margin">Iſaiah 53.</note> he made a full Satisfaction, or a Complete Redemption. Now that one Man, as a Repreſentative, ſhould bear the ſins of many, ſeems no way ſtrange; for under the Jewiſh Law, we read of the Scape Goat, on whoſe head the Prieſt transferr'd the ſins of the People with a kind of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> which Goat was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after driven out of the Camp into the Wilderneſs, as a Creature utterly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and abandon'd. How much more capable then was Jeſus of bearing the ſins of many, who indeed was the thing it ſelf Symboliz'd by that Creature; thus much concerns Chriſt's humane Nature in which he ſuffer'd: But when we call to mind, that the Puniſhment due to the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, not onely of the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but alſo of the Commandment given to <hi>Adam</hi> was Eternal Death, as the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Law was Eternal Life; 'twas neceſſary that this Redeemer or publick Repreſentative of Mankind, ſhould make an infinite ſatisfaction, which ſince it could
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100786:124"/>
not be <hi>ex parte Poenis,</hi> for then muſt he have ſuffer'd and been damn'd to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it remains that both his Active and Paſſive ſatisfaction was infinite <hi>ex parte Perſonoe,</hi> and conſequently, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer muſt be God alſo, ſo that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuffering, was Eternal and Infinite, though the capacity in which he ſuffer'd, was Infinite and Mortal. This Redeemer therefore was to doe whatſoever Men were oblig'd to doe, whether by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as he was to ſuffer alſo the Puniſhments due to all Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>By him therefore was the Law fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, as alſo the Ceremonial and Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Laws aboliſh'd, by exhibiting the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or thing it ſelf, to which they had Relation. In him all the Types and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices had their true Signification; in him were all Predictions terminated; and when all this was done, the bleſſed Jeſus made an Offering of himſelf to God, commending his Spirit into the hands of his Father, and together with it, the plenary Redemption of the World, in that full and comparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ejaculation of his Soul, crying or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming with his laſt Breath, <hi>it is Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have taken a ſhort view of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt as our Redeemer, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100786:125"/>
which we are requir'd to believe. Let us in the next place take a tranſient Glance of Chriſt's Doctrine as our Legiſlatour, and this concerns matter of Practice. This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is amply propounded to us in the <hi>5th. 6th.</hi> and <hi>7th.</hi> Chap. of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, where we have his moſt correct and true Explanation of the Decalogue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as was according to the true ſcope of the Law, and the Intention of the Law-giver, of which we have ſpoken already; we have alſo his moſt lively Deſcription, and earneſt Recommendations of theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent duties of Alms, Faſting and Prayer. We are taught Humility, Meekneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Purity of Affection, Patience under Perſecutions. Chearfulneſs under Slanders and Reproach, and Comfort under Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We are taught to live Peaceably, and to live Exemptorily; to ſhun Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to unite our ſelves to God by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of Piety, by holy Duties of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Penance, and by relying upon God's Providence in renouncing the Riches of the World, and avoiding Hypocriſie, and by a prudent Circumſpection, with many other Heavenly Duties and Inſtructions; and laſt of all, by a due Preparation of our ſelves for a general Judgment and life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. This is the ſubject matter of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sermon upon the Mount, and indeed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100786:125"/>
the ſumm and ſubſtance of all Evangelical Duties; we are taught in other places how to addreſs our ſelves to God by Prayer, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that moſt Excellent and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive form which is alone ſufficient to prove the Divinity of its Author; we have alſo many Evangelical Counſels, touching voluntary Chaſtity, and our abdication of Riches. He inſtituted holy Sacraments, as inſtruments of conveying Grace, and as Symbols of his Death and Paſſion; as alſo of his Eternal Union with his Church, and as a Bond of Union and Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians. He took Law for the future Enlargement and Government of his Church, by appointing his Apoſtles the Overſeers of it, endowing St. <hi>Peter</hi> with many ſingular Prerogatives; and laſt of all, he promis'd them the aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit to-direct and comfort them, all which was verified in a wonderful manner.</p>
            <p>As touching the Nature and Obligation of Evangelical Works, it is a point which will require a little to be inſiſted on; for ſome there are who allow of Evangelical Works, but not as Commands, but as Counſels only; and as ſuch indeed which may adorn our Profeſſion, but yet that they are to be taken up or left at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Profeſſour. And to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this, they tell us; That Chriſt came
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100786:126"/>
not with a Legiſlative Power to introduce new Laws, but to confirm the Moral: And therefore that all thoſe Paſſages in the <hi>5th. 6th.</hi> and <hi>7th.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> with whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe accrues in the Evangeliſts of this Nature, have not the Authority of Precepts, but are ſeaſonous' only, and were propos'd by Chriſt as Invitations to embrace his Faith; and no doubt very privilegious, being much to this purpoſe. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt;</hi> that is, I require you to cut off your right Hands, to pluck out your right Eyes, to bleſs them that curſe you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to ſweeten all with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe; I tell you, that whoſoever would ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it. This we ſee is the Goſpel Stile, and had our Saviour us'd this Rhetorick by way of Invitation, there needed no other Argument to prove the World's Converſion to have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous. No rational Man can be ſo blind as to believe, that Chriſt us'd this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to allure us to him; that by which he ſought, and which prov'd moſt effectual, to win Men over to Chriſtianity, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Happineſs and Eternity of another Life; and for the procurement hereof, he prov'd the Exerciſe of Self-denial, and true Severities in theſe and ſuch like Paſſages, as the beſt Expedient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:100786:126"/>
And that theſe Precepts were not bare Explanations of the Moſaical Law, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, but had in themſelves the force of binding Laws, is very demonſtrable from Chriſt's own Works. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind.</hi> This is the firſt and great Commandment, and the ſecond is like unto it: <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> which words, though they have Relation to the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Decalogue, yet do they exact much more than what is requir'd in them. The ten Commandments being almoſt all Negatives, confeſt in theſe two general Prohibitions of Worſhipping falſe Gods, and of injuring our Neighbour; whereas Chriſt's commands goe farther. They are poſitive and require our utmoſt endeavours to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the wellfare of our Neighbour, though he be our Enemy, whom the Jewiſh Law allowed to hate. Farther, the Moral Law had reſpect onely to the Act, Chriſt's Law extends to our very Thoughts. Nay, we may obſerve the like difference in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Law; there an <hi>Eye for an Eye,</hi> &amp;c. Evil was to be compenſated with Evil, but here is no <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> no returning of like for like, but on the contrary; a quiet ſubmiſſion to him who offers Violence, and inſtead of revenging an old Injury, to be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100786:127"/>
prepar'd to receive a new one. Add to this, that Chriſt requires many penetenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Duties, ſuch as Faſting, Prayer, giving of Alms and the like, all which being much more than what was requir'd under the Moſaical Ordinances, and running in the Style and Tenour of abſolute Commands, muſt have the Authority of Laws, and obligations conſequently to the obſervance of them, which would farther appear ſhould we conſider the Efficacy of ſuch Duties in the work of our Salvation. But 'tis not my buſineſs here to engage into diſpute: I will poſt on therefore in the courſe of this Argument, to conſider what is without diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Authority of Chriſt's Meſſiah-ſhip, as it is repreſented in his Life and Miracles.</p>

            </head>
            <p>HAving given a ſhort Syſteme of the Doctrinal part of the Evangeliſts, we are in the next place to conſider of the Hiſtorical, as it relates to the Life and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the holy Jeſus; or to ſpeak more properly, both theſe are but one: For the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100786:127"/>
Life of Jeſus is nothing but one great and continu'd Miracle. He enter'd upon the Throne in a manner very different from thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> of Old. He was born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger, and expos'd to the cold of the Seaſon, and to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconveniences which attended that great confluence of People occaſion'd by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Decree. Preſently after he was born, under pretence of being Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd, he was hunted after by the moſt execrable <hi>Herod</hi> to be murther'd. He was hurried from place to place in the Arms of his tender Mother, the ever bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who was expos'd to perpetual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Fears, Sorrows, and many wants and difficulties as to all wordly helps. He was forc'd to ſly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Houſe of Bondage, that he might find relief and ſafety. He was the reputed Son of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt laborious Carpenter; he liv'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a poor inconſiderate Village, then remarkable only for its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and by the Jews held ignoble to a Proverb: Hence it was, that by way of contempt he was call'd a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> and the primitive Chriſtians out of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt were called <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> witneſs that calumnious Invective of <hi>Tertullus</hi> againſt St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He was alſo called a <hi>Galiloean</hi> in a way of Ignominy, by <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Porphyry;</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100786:128"/>
his Condition of Life was in ſome reſpect worſe than that of the Beaſts and Fowls of the Air; for he had no certain place of Habitation, where to retreat at ſuch time as he began to enter upon his Commiſſion. As to all worldly appearance, he was poor and deſtitute, perſecuted and defam'd; walking always in the midſt of Snares and Treacheries, converſing with Publicans and Sinners, and attended only with a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable Fiſhermen. This was the State and Grandeur, this was the Pomp and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of our great and immortal <hi>Hero,</hi> and yet ſtill there was a Heavenly Luſtre break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in the midſt of all theſe Clouds, through every Paſſage of his Life, and when moſt eclips'd, he was glorified with ſome Rays of a Divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As to the Vertues of his Soul they were ineffable; he was always doing Good, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Evil; always Teaching<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and by his own Example, proving the verity of what he Taught; always relieving Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s neceſſities, whether Temporal or Spiritual, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Infirmities: He was chearful and yet innocent in his Converſation, and in his Reproofs indulgent, and yet ſevere. He was pitiful towards the afflicted, and rigorous with none but with the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hypocrites, and the boaſting and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious Phariſees. He was more pure
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100786:128"/>
and chaſte than Angels, moſt gentle and ſweet in his Diſpoſition, lovely and meek in his Deportment, negligent of Himſelf, but moſt vigilant, zealous and active for the Glory of God, and never diſcompos'd by any extravagance of Anger, Fear, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Joy, or any other Intemperance of Paſſion whatſoever, though he ſometimes expreſs'd his Tenderneſs for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by moſt compaſſionate Ejaculations, and by a flood of Tears. Whereſoever he went, he made himſelf to be known, and publick by great acts of Charity and Self-denial: One while we find him diſputing with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Scribes and Phariſees, confounding them with his Anſwers, and eluding all their Captious and Treacherous Diſcourſes with a Wiſdom equal to that of a Serpent, but defending his own Integrity with the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Dove. As to his manner of expreſſing himſelf, it was by Parables, which way of ſpeaking made a laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Minds of Men, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Spiritual things under ſuch ſenſible Forms as were obvious to the Capacities of all, and eaſie to be remembred; but withall they were of incomparable weight and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and truly, ſuch is the Scope, Pertinence, and Veracity of theſe ſacred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, as could proceed from no other than the Son of God. But above all, his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100786:129"/>
laſt Speech and Diſcourſe with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after his laſt Supper is moſt Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Divine, firmly to be read by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and capable to inſpire the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Soul with the love of Martyrdom; and they ſhew ſufficiently with what a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial Reſignation of himſelf to the Will of God, with what melting Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Diſciples, and with what a holy and ardent Charity towards the World, this holy Victim was prepar'd to make his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>

To the Life of Chriſt we refer all thoſe outwards Conſiderations of his Parentage, Birth, Countrey, Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100786:129"/>
Fortune, with ſuch like Circumſtances as attended his Mortal State. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son, is not his Mother called</hi>

            <p>To theſe and ſuch like ſcandalous Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, 'tis anſwer'd; That Chriſt's Exinaniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or his diveſting himſelf of his Glory, by aſſuming that ſervile State, under which he is every where repreſented to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, was neceſſary upon a double account. Firſt, for an Example of Vertue. Secondly for the greater declaration of his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100786:130"/>
Had not Chriſt been ſubject to Paſſions, Man might readily have repli'd; true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis my endeavour as well as my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, not to ſin; but alas, I am compell'd to yield to Nature, I am oppreſs'd and burthened with the infirmities of my Fleſh, of my own weak and frail Nature, ſo that the evil which I would not doe, that doe I. Now to cut of all ſuch Evaſions, what better expedient could there be, than for Chriſt to atteſt and experimentally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that Fleſh and Blood had a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not to ſin, and Abilities to purſue its own happineſs, and this from his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, who was himſelf moleſted with the like Infirmities; manners are ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reformed by Example than by Precept. Thus was it neceſſary that our Saviour ſhould be <hi>made like unto us in all things, ſin excepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, as his knowledge was a Precedent for our Invitation, ſo was it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly conducing to the Declaration of his own Glory; this will appear more fully by and by, when we come to conſider the conſequences of Chriſt's converſe with Men, and the wonderful ſucceſs his Doctrine has found in the Converſion of the World. Had Chriſt appear'd like ſome temporal Prince, attended with pompous Trains, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by Great, Wiſe, and Learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100786:131"/>
and ſtrengthned with the alliances of ſecular Princes, and with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a Civil and Military Power, the whole fabrick of Chriſtianity might juſtly have been ſuſpected for a thing of humane Invention and Policy, and liable to be ruin'd by force or civil Alterations. But when we ſhall with Amazement conſider, that all thoſe grand Revolutions which follow'd in the World's Converſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from one ſo ſeemingly impotent, and utterly deſtitute of all ſuitable means and inſtruments for ſo great an Enterprice, and this too by ſuffering an accurſs'd death; reaſon muſt conclude, that the Author of ſuch a Miraculous change, could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but God; and that the Religion which he introduced, muſt be Immutable and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. As for Chriſt's Converſation with Publicans and Sinners, 'twas no other than what was foretold of him, and what he himſelf openly averr'd to be expedient, ſince he came to ſave that which was loſt, and that they were not the righteous and the ſound, but the ſinners and the ſick which mov'd him to Compaſſion, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires his preſence; for where ſhould the Phyſician be but amongſt his diſeas'd Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents who implore his help.</p>
            <p>Another thing for which many Men through all Ages have been offended with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100786:131"/>
the bleſſed Jeſus, is the ſeeming ſeverity of his Doctrine; for he that will be Chriſt's Diſciple, muſt take up his Croſs and deny himſelf: And for this purpoſe let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Dominion, Honour, Riches, Fame, Pleaſures, with all thoſe fady Beauties or Parents of Happineſs, which fill our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, to be placed before us; let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe likewiſe Chriſtianity to be array'd in its moſt homely dreſs, as preſenting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Want and Difficulties, Hatred and Diſgrace: As requiring us to return Good for Evil, Bleſſings for Curſes, to feed our Enemies, and to afflict our ſelves. Of theſe two Eſtates, Nature prompts us to chooſe the former; Chriſt requires us to prefer the later, in which Caſe the will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be under violent Temptations: For although Chriſt requires not our Services for nothing, but has annex'd Rewards to our Duties, and ſuch as infinitely exceed the worth and merit of the performance; yet ſince theſe Rewards are Spiritual, and to be receiv'd in another Life, 'tis certain they can never ſway the Majority of Men, who making ſenſe to be the meaſure of their Happineſs, cannot but unite their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to things viſible and near at hand. Nay, it requires a Man to have a well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Faith, and to be fortified with hardy Reſolutions, who being to balance his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100786:132"/>
felt Calamities againſt conceiv'd Felicity, ſhall chooſe rather to lie under the weight of his preſent Miſeries, than forfeit his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to ſuch Contents as are future and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the face of Religion, like that of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Statue anciently at <hi>Chios,</hi> ſeems ſad and cloudy to thoſe who are to enter, but to them that are within, it appears ſerene and chearfull. The Goſpel at the firſt appearance ſeems rigid and undelight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; it wants that face or varniſh which affects the Senſe, yet to them who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, its ways are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs. To prove this, we need no more but to conjecture, Friſt, the great Rewards which crown our Sufferings, which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards though they be future, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſupport our Hopes, being founded in God's veracity. This is no more than what we may obſerve in the ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of Life, where we find daily what hardſhip Men endure, what diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments they wraſtle with, and what expenſe they lie at to purchaſe perhaps ſome ſmall Eſtate or Office, or to acquire ſome little Title of Honour, which things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure may never be obtain'd, or if they be, Men are but faſter hamper'd in the ſnare, and by pains arrive to greater pains; what is this World's Glory, but the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100786:132"/>
breath of popular Air? and yet ſo deſirous are Men of this breath of others, that in the purſuit thereof, they have many times loſt their own; when yet the Rewards which Chriſtians are invited to by Goſpel Duties are ſo Solid and Eternal. In the next place, the Duties of Chriſtianity will yet appear to be more eaſie and ſupportable, if we conſider the Aſſiſtance promis'd to Mens endeavours, and the Mercy and Pardon upon their Repentance for their failings. Beſides, affirmative commands are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be obſerv'd, nor do they ſo much require the actual Performances, as the Thoughts and Diſpoſition of the Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> to be reſolv'd to ſuffer Pains, and Ignominy of the Croſs, and to forſake all Temporal Enjoyments for the ſake of Almighty God when occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, though there were no Rewards annext to the Obſervance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties, yet is there no juſt reaſon to except againſt them as rigid and ſevere; for as much as even in this Life they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry along with them their own Reward. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> I confeſs were Men of ſome Principles; for they held that a Man might <note place="margin">Tul. l. 5. de finibus Bon. &amp; Mal.</note> be then moſt happy, when he was moſt miſerable; not as though Miſery were Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs formally and in it ſelf, but materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally only: Becauſe as an Object it miniſters
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100786:133"/>
occaſion for a Man to exert thoſe Acts of vertue which conſtitute him happy. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Doctrine of theirs were only a Bravery of Speculation, or a fixt Perſuaſion and Belief, is not my buſineſs to determine: Thus much it ſheweth, that theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who ſaw only by the divine light of Nature, and knew little of another life, had ſuch apprehenſions of the Excellency of Man's Nature, as to think all outward Objects, though never ſo repugnant to it, to be too weak and inſufficient to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; which conſideration is of infinite more force in a Chriſtian upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he has of another Life. But waving this, as I have now ſtated the matter; let us examine it a little by the Meaſures and Circumſtances of this preſent Life. Men naturally are of a Temper which is haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vindicative; Chriſt requires his Followers to be humble, and long ſuffering under all provocations whatſoever. Let us now ſee which is eaſier to follow, he who is ſway'd by inclinations of Revenge, with how many reſtleſs hours muſt he be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in contriving means for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it; with what loſs of Time, Content, Reputation, and perhaps Eſtate and Death, does he combate his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments to diſturb thoſe of him he hates, which whether he compaſs or fail of, he is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100786:133"/>
equally miſerable. Whereas the good Chriſtian ſuffers but a ſhort conflict with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, in reſiſting the firſt reſentments of Nature, and then he is at reſt; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, he acquires a reputation of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue amongſt all good Men, by whom he is belov'd and honour'd; and acquires alſo an entire and noble conqueſt over his Enemy by the all-ſubduing Arms of Love; for there was never Man ſo devoted to Malice, as would for ever perſecute a vertuous and proſtrate Innocence. Nature prompts Men to Luſt, to Pleaſures, to Ambition and the like; I need not enlarge upon the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch diſorders. It is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very copious and pleaſing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where ſpoken to with good ſucceſs; when on the contrary the good Chriſtian by reſiſting theſe Temptations of Life, is not only deliver'd from all their fatal Effects, but by confining his Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments within theſe due Limits, or by transferring his Paſſions upon nobler Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he meets with a full ſatisfaction of his deſires in a ſolid Fruition of himſelf, and taſtes the chaſte pleaſures of Angels in a Reflection upon the Innocence and ſpotleſs Tenour of his Life. Whilſt he who lets his unbridled Paſſion range through all the Regions of ſenſual Delights, which fancy can create, does but ſhorten his days, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100786:134"/>
poiſon even thoſe ſmall Enjoyments of the life he ſpends with perpetual Diſorders, and with irreparable Detriment.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:100786:134"/>
As for thoſe <hi>Miranda</hi> recorded in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Stories, as the ſpeaking of <hi>Juno</hi>'s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that of a Child of ſix Months old proclaimed Triumph in <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Augar's</hi> catting a Whet-ſtone with a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour, ſo much admired by <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> with other ſuch like Prodigies of Fame amongſt the Ancients; 'tis plain, they were no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, being ſuch as might eaſily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded by Colluſidn, and lay not without the compaſs of Natural Agents. Of this kind were the wonders wrought by the Magicians under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as alſo thoſe which are reported of <hi>Appolonius</hi> by <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vide Mart. Derio. Mag. Diſq. l. 1. c. 4. quaeſ. 4.</note> and of one <hi>Zedekiah</hi> a Jew in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperour. All which for the Devil to have effected, either by Local Motion, by the applying of Actives to Paſſives, or by making ſome Alteration upon the Medium, or in the ſight of the Beholder, was not a matter of any great difficulty. I know that Heathen Stories are famous for the Miracles of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> but when we call to mind that intimate familiarity which was betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> who was with him alſo at <hi>Alexandria</hi> when he wrought his Cure, 'tis more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that what's reported of him in this Nature, was but a piece of Artifice and Deluſion; or, admitting it to have been real,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100786:135"/>
yet was it not without the compaſs of Natural Cauſes. For <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, that <note place="margin">Tac. lib. 4. Hiſtor.</note> when <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> ask'd his Phyſicians whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch defects were recoverable by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means; they anſwer'd, they were, might convenient remedies be applied. <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> he ſaught not to confirm his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by Miracles, but by the Sword; but of him by and by.</p>
            <p>Thoſe then are truly Miracles which cannot be produc'd by the Natural Power of any created Agent, or be obtruded on us by Impoſture; and of this kind were thoſe urg'd by our Saviour to <hi>John</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: For who ever heard of any that raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dead, and gave ſight to the Blind? And let me ſpeak it with Reverence, that had our Saviour mention'd any other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as his turning of Water into Wine, his walking upon the Sea, his feeding of 5000 with a few Loaves and the like; they could never have won Men over to a belief of that for which they were brought in Proof, even that Chriſt was the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Meſſiah. For albeit, ſuch Miracles were true, becauſe impoſſible to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100786:135"/>
by the Immediate virtue of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſe whatſoever; nevertheleſs they could not have been convincing, it being poſſible for the Devil to counterfeit the like by a quick Tranſportation and Exchange of Bodies, or by a ſpeedy ſupply of new Matter; in which caſe it would be very difficult to diſcern the true Miracles from thoſe which were falſe and ſpecious. What is reported of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> may ſerve for an Inſtance: He could appear flying in the Air, he could transform himſelf into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Shapes, and turn Stones into Bread, which no doubt was done by the Devil in imitation of Chriſt's Miracles laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, not by any true converſion, but by a ſudden and inſenſible conveyance of one body into the room of another.</p>
            <p>The Efficacy of Chriſt's Miracles for the conviction of Atheiſts, is ſufficiently prov'd from the credit of the Reporters of them, the holy Apoſtles: That the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did tranſmit the Memory of them to future Ages, by their writings contained in the New Teſtament, is prov'd upon that more than Moral, certainly we have from Univerſal Tradition; and that they made no falſe Reports in this matter, is prov'd alſo beyond all diſpute in their infinite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for the belief of Chriſt, and from the miraculous ſucceſs their Doctrines
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100786:136"/>
found in obliging the whole World to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their belief. The evidence of which Truth is as clear and convincing as ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſince the firſt Creation, as will appear more fully in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

            <p>ANother General Argument to prove the Truth of Jeſus's Meſſiah-ſhip, as alſo the Verity of his Religion, is taken from the Events and Conſequences of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, in the conqueſt it made over all the World, and this in two Reſpects; firſt over Devils, ſecond-over Men. And firſt for Devils; Thoſe many famous or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infamous Oracles, to which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens for ſo many Ages had recourſe, and paid ſo great a Veneration, about the time of Chriſt's appearance, began univerſally to ſink and diminiſh in their Credit, and a little after become utterly abandon'd. That renowned one of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> was mute in the Times of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and as for the others of Greece, as of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi>

               <hi>Eloea, Tegyra,</hi> as alſo that of <hi>Ammon,</hi> ſo much celebrated amongſt the Heathens; <hi>Plutarch</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Plutarch lib. de defect.

No leſs remarkable is that known Paſſage of the ſame Author in the account he gives of <hi>Epitherſes,</hi> who ſailing near the Iſles call'd the <hi>Echinades,</hi> heard a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Voice, as did all the reſt who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, crying from the ſhore: <hi>The great</hi> Pan <hi>was dead.</hi> Whereupon follow'd a moſt doleful noiſe of Harlings and Groans; which thing when told <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he was much amaz'd, conſulting the Philoſophers there in <hi>Rome,</hi> who this <hi>Pan</hi> ſhould be: Now 'twas under <hi>Tiberius</hi> that Chriſt was crucified.</p>
            <p>The other great Conqueſt which the Chriſtian Religion made, was over Men, and they were of two ſorts, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: As for the Jews, 'tis notorious with what malicious Calumnies, with what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Conſpiracies, with what open Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, with what perfidious Subornations, with what indefatigable Travels, and with what a conſtant and univerſal Concurrence they all endeavour'd the ſuppreſſion and utter deſtruction of a few followers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. They ſtirr'd up the People every where,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100786:137"/>
not only in their own Teritories, but in all the adjacent Countrys round about, to lay Hands upon the poor Diſciples, and their Friends. One while they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to expoſe them to the Sword of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as Adherents to ſome new King; other whiles they charg'd them with Blaſphemy, and as Prevaricators from their Law, and every where they were branded with Ignominy, and with the dangerous Characters of Factions and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. This we find lively painted out by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and more particularly exemplified in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of whoſe Character and Deportment 'twill not be unſeaſonable to take a tranſient veiw.</p>
            <p>This bleſſed Inſtrument of the World's Converſion, was at firſt, we read, a moſt violent perſecutour of the Chriſtians, and was ſo much the more dangerous; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was not animated by private Animoſity, or with a wanton humour of ſeeking applauſe by a popular Zeal, but by a ſerious perſuaſion and conviction of Conſcience, that what he did, was for the Glory of Almighty God: And certainly when Men are once of this Perſuaſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their belief be Orthodox or Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they cannot chooſe but raiſe great Commotions, and will combate with inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100786:137"/>
difficulties. And thus it was with this bleſſed Apoſtle, till ſuch time as he was miraculouſly converted, and with the change of his Name, which happened a little after, was dignified with a nobler change of his Nature, and of a ravenous Wolf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a vigilant and painfull Sheepherd. With what popular Clamours and open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence did the Jews ſeek him every where to ſuppreſs this Convert? With what hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Plots and Snares did they labour every where to ſuppreſs him? How often was he whipt and ſcourg'd to the utmoſt ſeverity of the Law, againſt which he never offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? His Sufferings are amply deſcrib'd by himſelf, in his 2 Epiſt to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> c. 11. which Epiſtle was wrote about the Year of Chriſt 58, and conſequently contain'd nothing of the Perſecutions and Afflictions of his following Life for eleven Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. With what indefatigable labour did he plant Religion almoſt in all Regions of the known World at that time? What Hardſhips and Miſeries did he ſuffer from Reproach, and Calumnies, from Hunger and Cold, and from Watchings and weary Travels. He was every where inveſted with Perils, aſſaulted with Temptations, and beſieg'd with Enemies; all which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Anxieties and Troubles of his Soul for the concerns and wellfare of all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100786:138"/>
the Churches; writing inſtructive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating Epiſtles every where, conforming himſelf to the neceſſities of others, and as much as in him lay, transferring the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of all the Chriſtian World upon his own ſhoulders, and willing to be made an Anathema himſelf for the good and ſafety of others, which he labour'd to promote by Preaching, Praying, Diſputing, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Exemplary living in all quarters of the World. With what noble courage did he always meet the Perſecuting Jews? with what prudential conduct did he avoid their Treacheries, and with what ſolid Reaſons did he combate their Errours? With what boldneſs of addreſs did he diſpute with the Philoſophers of <hi>Athens,</hi> the only Maſters of the World for the Acts of Argument and Judicature? Where ever he went, he made his Conqueſts over the Judgments and Wills of others, as well as over his own Paſſions. His own dangers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties were the leaſt part of his Trouble; the wellfare of others was that which fill'd his Mind with an Apoſtolick Solicitude. Let any Man judge of a Perſon in his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and who held ſuch a vaſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with all parts of the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted World, which was then oppugn'd every where; what infinite Letters and Addreſſes muſt be made to him from all
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100786:138"/>
places, to all which he was oblig'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; whether they concern'd Caſes of Conſcience amongſt thoſe, eſpecially of the Circicumſion, or whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Church Doctrines and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the behaviour of the Primitive Chriſtians, under ſo many Temptations and Difficulties as occurr'd every where? What continuances of Adverſaries, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, what Sollicitations from Friends, what vaſt deſigns for the Eternal wellfare of Mankind employ'd his Thoughts, and fill'd all the ſpacious Rooms and ſecret Receſſes of his Soul? What triumphing over the blandiſhments and diſcouragements of the World, over Crowns and Empires, over Honours, Riches, Strength, Wiſdom and Eloquence with whatſoever elſe might influence a wordly Genius; he erects the Standard of the Croſs, declaring openly to the Learned and Illiterate, to the Noble and Obſcure; that he came not with the Artifice of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing Words, nor the Inventions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Knowledge, but with ſimplicity of Conceptions and Expreſſions to Preach Chriſt crucified. This he demonſtrated with an undoubted Courage, in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or Apology for the Chriſtian Faith at <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> as alſo againſt the Defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the high Prieſts, and the chiefeſt of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100786:139"/>
the Jewiſh Nation, though ſtrengthned with the plauſible Inſinuations, and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Invectives of their Orator, <hi>Tertullus:</hi> All which things were tranſacted in a moſt publick Audience, before <hi>Felix, Feſtus,</hi> and <hi>King Agrippa,</hi> and after many difficulties of a dangerous Voyage, he had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the laſt place to plead his Cauſe more than once before the Terrour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the moſt bloody <hi>Nero;</hi> from whom alſo, as a juſt Reward of his cauſe and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he received a Lawrel far more noble than what adorn'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Brow, even that glorious one of Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>His defence doubtleſs was much the ſame with what he made before <hi>Feſtus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa;</hi> however it has pleaſed Almighty God to ſuffer ſuch a noble Monument of Primitive Glory to be loſt, as are alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Illuſtrious Tranſactions of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtles: Nevertheleſs, divers of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, which by God's good Providence are deliver'd to us by the Church, ſhew ſufficiently with what a Spirit he was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. They are Argumentative and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found in the Doctrinal part: His precepts carry the Majeſty of Oracles, and yet do they flow every where with the ſweet Streams of Tenderneſs and Compaſſion; like Lightning melting the Steel within, even the reſiſting parts, or the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

heart without hurting the Body; we find him every where glorying with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphick Charity, more chaſte and laſting than any Veſtal Fire, and more ſacred than the Flames of Altars, burning always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being conſum'd. In ſhort, we find him carying always in a mortified Body the Characters of a crucified Chriſt, but of a glorified Jeſus in the elevation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which he every where diſcovers both in the perpetual Activity, and (if I may ſpeak it without a Soleciſm) in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Tranquillity alſo of his Mind. The ſame divine Vertues which adorn'd the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are remarkable alſo in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in the reſt of Chriſt's Diſciples, whoſe Conqueſts we are in the next place to conſider in reſpect of the Pagan World.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Government at the time of Chriſt's appearance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all the known and civiliz'd World; let us ſee in what a State and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they then ſtood. Their Empire was then at the higheſt Pitch, and in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Power, Extent and Luſtre, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter far than ever any Empire before or ſince. <hi>Rome,</hi> the capital City of this vaſt Body, upon a Survey made by <hi>Claudius,</hi> (call'd a <hi>Luſtrum,)</hi> containd no leſs than ſix Millions, nine hundred forty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100786:140"/>
Souls, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports. Humane <note place="margin">Tacit. Lib. 11. Hiſt.</note> Arts and Learning then flouriſh'd moſt; then liv'd the acuteſt Philoſophers, and the greateſt Bigots of Heatheniſm. Their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs and Flamines, with ſuch like Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their ſuperſtitious Worſhip, fill'd an infinite number of Colleges, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded every where. There was neither Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor Zeal wanting in the Emperours and Senate to defend their Rites; neither was their Torments wanting to be inflicted on thoſe who ſhould oppoſe them; in a word, never were the Powers of Earth, or rather of Hell in a better poſture for combat. In oppoſition to this great and formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado, they appear on the other ſide a few deſpicable Fiſhermen, and Illiterate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks; mere Idiots in the eye of the World, and deſtitute of Friends, Learning, and Policy; without Arms, or Money in their Scrips, without change of Apparel, and with a ſtaff only in their Hands, half naked and forlorn: This, at firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, looks more fabulous than a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but that the Caſe thus ſtood is clear and indiſputable.</p>
            <p>Now that ſuch a few humble and ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Champions ſhould enter the Liſts againſt ſuch Enemies as are now deſcrib'd, was a Prodigy beyond Example; and yet they did ſo, and with what ſucceſs we ſhall
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100786:140"/>
ſee preſently. Twelve poor Diſciples, with a few Converts, did attack this great and adverſe party, not by keeping themſelves united into a cloſe body, but by ſcattering themſelves through all quarters of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. They erected their Standard (the ever glorious Banner of the Croſs) even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, the centre of Pagan Rites, and this too in the Reign of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and bloody Tyrant that ever ſate on the Throne. They preach'd up Jeſus, who was crucified and buried, and was with-drawn from them as to all ſenſible appearance: They taught that the way to Happineſs was by Suffering, to be Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by enduring Ignominy, to be Rich by ſelling all, to obtain Liberty by Bonds and Impriſonments, and to be Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours by being Subdu'd and Perſecuted. They taught alſo, That Men were as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their ſinfull Thoughts as for their Actions; and that every extravagance of deſire was to be reſiſted: To all which they were to join Faſtings and Watchings, Alms and Prayers; and that Cold, Nakedneſs, Hunger and Thirſt, Perſecutions, and even Death it ſelf were to be endur'd cheraful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and all this and much more for the ſake of that Jeſus who was Crucified, and from whom alſo they were to expect their Reward in another Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:100786:141"/>
Such Doctrine, deliver'd from ſuch a ſort of Men, one would think to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty plauſible to convince the proud Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; as alſo the haughty and imperious <hi>Romans,</hi> who breath'd nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Triumphs: And ſtill the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſeems more impoſſible if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with what Arms and Weapons the <hi>Romans</hi> made their Defence, <hi>viz.</hi> with Swords and Creſts, with Mines and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with wild Beaſts and Racks, and with all the Artillery of Subtilty and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. And yet notwithſtanding all theſe Difficulties on one ſide, and on the other, theſe few Diſciples of Jeſus enter'd upon their Warfare; they brake through all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, which oppos'd them, by withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the diſputes of Philoſophers, all the Placarts of the Senate, all the Priſons and Tortures of the Officers, with infinite other hardſhips, ſtill attending their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Baptizing, Preaching, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at length Seal'd the Truth of their Belief and Doctrine with their Blood; an Eternal proof indeed of its Truth. For though Men may lye ſometimes for Gain, yet we never heard of any, much leſs ſo many and for ſo many Ages, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in a lye that they might be Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and when they might enjoy all the Comforts of life by following Truth, would
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100786:141"/>
voluntarily plunge themſelves into a train of perpetual Calamities, both in this World and that to come, by aſſerting falſhood.</p>
            <p>And indeed, as the natural Weakneſs and the ſupernatural Courage and conſtancy of the Abettours of Chriſtianity heard its Truth; ſo alſo that this Truth was of a Divine Extraction and Vertue, is farther demonſtrable from the Poſſeſſion it got in the Minds of the moſt prejudic'd Men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Judgments, Wills and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contrary to all humane Intereſts and natural Inclinations whatſoever. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> after ſo long a continuance, and even in the Infancy of Chriſtianity, flouriſhing in thoſe great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Reaſon, <hi>Plotirus, Lorgirus</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrus,</hi> could never ſo inſinuate into the Miracles and Manners of Men, as to draw any one Village throughout the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Principles, and make them live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Preſcripts and Rules of its Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Progreſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was ſo Univerſal and Early, that even in the days of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> his Doctrine had converted ſome of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s houſhold, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. as in the beginning of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Reign, we read of <hi>Flavia Domiſilla,</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the imperial Blood, who with her two Eunuchs, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Of the Mahometan Religion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Mahometan Superſtition makes the laſt Branch of reveal'd (or of a pretendedly reveal'd) Religion; this falls in moſt opportunely to be ſpoken to, as being in appearance the greateſt Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can poſſibly be made againſt the Truth of Chriſtianity, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when impartialy and throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, will afford us one of the greateſt Arguments to prove its Divine Authority; upon which conſideration, I have reſerv'd the handlings of this Point to the laſt place; for as much as <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the greateſt and moſt Mortal Enemy, which hitherto hath appear'd againſt it, and therefore the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to follow it in its Triumph.</p>
            <p>In the Mahometan Religion then, there are two things, at firſt ſight, which occurr to our Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Its Duration, and its Extent; as for its Duration, it has flouriſhed, or rather inſected the World for above a thouſand years; and then for its Extent, although its Original was from an obſcure Impoſture, yet in leſs than Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Years, the Diſciples of this Sect,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100786:143"/>
under the name of <hi>Saracens,</hi> had diffus'd themſelves over <hi>Armenia, Perſia, Paleſtine, Egypt, Lybia,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Africa;</hi> and for ſome Ages paſt, even to this very day, they poſſeſs the largeſt and nobleſt parts of the habitable World in the Perſian and Ottoman Empires, the better part of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi> as alſo all <hi>Tartary,</hi> with three quarters alſo of <hi>Africa;</hi> ſo that the Creſcent ſeems in a great Meaſure to verifie that arrogant Prediction of growing greater and greater, <hi>donec totum impleat orbem.</hi> Now that ſuch a Peſtilent Sect ſhould ſo long triumph over, and almoſt extenuate the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and ſpread its Roots and Branches wider alſo, is a point which at the firſt ſight may ſeem to ſtagger us; but how formidable ſoever this Scandal may appear to a young Believer, we ſhall find no great danger in it, if we conſider.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Circumſtances of the Age when this Innovation firſt began. It was about the Year 630, and in the Reign of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is ſaid to have departed this Life, before which time almoſt the ſpace of 200 Years; the <hi>Vandals</hi> had over-run almoſt all <hi>Africa,</hi> a Countrey always famous for Wild Beaſts and Monſters; ſo that almoſt all that vaſt Tract or Region being overcome with Barbarity and Ignorance, the Soil ſeem'd
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100786:143"/>
ready prepar'd for Weeds to grow in; to which conſideration we may add that alſo of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church, over-run with Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſm, and contending with the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> for the Primacy. All this the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour underſtood very well, as alſo that Ignorance naturally leads Men to Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And as the ſtate and circumſtances of the <hi>7th.</hi> Century ſuited well with the Genius and deſign of ſuch a Prophet, ſo may we obſerve alſo the like Diſpoſition and Confluence of Cauſes in the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages to propagate and enlarge the ſame. For the <hi>Hunns, Goths, Vandals,</hi> (whoſe uncouth Names are of harſh and barbarous ſound,) ſtill thronging in upon all quarters of the Empire, diſturb'd the repoſe and courſe of things; whilſt the greater Prelates contending with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and purſuing their ancient Quarrels about Precedency, and entring into new ones with the ſecular Power, about Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Rights of Inveſtiture; all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in a manner degenerated into Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Faction, and Superſtition. By this means, I ſay, the Mahometan Doctrine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd apace, and the Princes who where of it, under the Titles of <hi>Caliphes</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> became formidable: Whereupon the Chriſtian Princes of the <hi>West,</hi> finding the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> either immers'd in Idleneſs and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100786:144"/>
Luxury, or unable to withſtand the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Sect, enter'd into a League call'd the <hi>Holy war,</hi> which for ſome time repell'd the Progreſs of the Mahometan Invaſions, till domeſtick Quarrels and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, together with Self-intereſt, made the Europeans abandon ſuch a glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and leave all as a Prey to the Ottoman Uſurpers, which ended in the total Ruine of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be taken notice of, is the Ottoman Empire it ſelf, which has for a long time been the moſt potent, and is at this day doubtleſs the greateſt in the World; if we conſider the extent of its Dominions. It is a vaſt Branch, or rather the very Body or Trunck of the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Religion; and as being the moſt bigotted and zealous in the Propagation of the ſame, it will not be improper to make ſome Reflections upon their Conduct in this particular.</p>
            <p>One of the chiefeſt Policies, or the grand <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the Ottomans, is to keep the common People in Ignorance, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Expoſition of all difficult Caſes, and the final Deciſion of their Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, into the Right Reverend the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who in all matters of conſequence depends upon the infallible Oracle the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour. To this end and purpoſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100786:144"/>
and prohibit all Learning, eſpecially Controverſial; for ſhould they attain to the underſtanding of Greek and Latin, they would quickly read the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and belief of others in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of former Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the Helps and Methods which they find in ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Antiquity, they would attain alſo to the Art of Reaſoning, which would draw them inſenſibly to examine their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and diſcover the groſs Abſurdities and Contradictions of their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> For ſo it is, that their Religion will not endure the ſtreſs of a Diſputation, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we find, that there was never one of this Perſuaſion of what continuance, and how wide ſoever it is, or hath been, that did ever offer to defend it by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Their next Policy is, to probibit the uſe of Printing; For ſhould this get place amongſt them, new Opinions would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſpread abroad, which would not only expoſe their Superſtition, but make great Convulſions in the very body of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 'Twas ſubtilly therefore done of one of their <hi>Kaimacans,</hi> who when a Printer came to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with his printing Inſtruments, and offer'd to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſome Books very cheap, caus'd him preſently to be ſtrangled, and all his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100786:145"/>
to be burnt; pretending, that 'twas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that one Man for a little gain ſhould take the Bread out of the Mouths of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Families who liv'd by Writing. A plauſible pretenſe indeed, though the true reaſon of this ſeverity was that which I am now diſcourſing of, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent the Innovations which a liberty of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation would infallibly introduce.</p>
            <p>Another Policy of the Mahometan Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, conſiſts in their abſtaining from all acquaintance with Foreign Nations. They never Travel themſelves, upon any account, not even upon the account of Traffick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Chriſtian Territories; by which means they are moſt groſly ignorant of what is taught or done in Foreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. All the knowledge they have is from Renegades and Fugitives, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſerve much Credit, and in Religious Matters is totally inſignificant: And as for thoſe who viſit their Countries, they are but few, there being no improvement to be made by an Ingenious and Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Traveller, which may compenſate the Riſque and Expence; all Foreigners being generally lookt upon by the Turks as Spies, and are therefore under a watchfull Eye and in Danger. To tamper therefore with them in matters of Religion, would prove Pernicious and Fatal: And as for our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100786:145"/>
who reſort to them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Commerce, their buſineſs is Trade and Gain; nor are they admitted but to a very ſmall acquaintance, and that only with Perſons of the meaner Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſuch with whom their Traffick lies.</p>
            <p>The laſt Turkiſh Policy, and which ſeems alſo to contribute much to the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Religion, is their conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to their more ancient Habits, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Manners of Living; ſo that whoſoever does converſe with them, muſt in a great Meaſure conform in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, unleſs he has a Mind to be expos'd to Contempt, or perhaps Dangers. This one particular, how trivial ſoever it may ſeem, cannot but create in theſe Muſiel-men a wonderfull Opinion of themſelves, and a kind of ſcorn and diſlike of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſagrees with them; and indeed, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy in ſuch matters cannot but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue much Levity, and we may obſerve our ſelves what Prejudice may ariſe from Cuſtom. For ſhould a Man walk the Streets with a Sugar-Loaf-Hat, with a ſlaſht Doublet, and ruffling Ribbons about the waſte and knees of his Breeches, and with party co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Stockings, and the like, he would be lookt upon as a Fool or Madman; and yet ſuch a Garb twenty five years ſince was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100786:146"/>
very agreeable and Court-like, how ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſoever it appears at preſent. The ſame Judgment may paſs in another Age upon our preſent Modes, which ſeem ſo decent and uſefull: So much does Cuſtom render things agreeable and familiar. In ſhort, that the conſtancy of the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans in their falſe Worſhip, does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Nature of their Religion, but from the foremention'd Cauſes, is moſt demonſtrable from thoſe of the Greek Church; who though they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the moſt unſetled in their Opinions, and the moſt eaſily won to any Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> where they live under a Government, which neither Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances Learning, Printing, Travel, nor Foreign Modes, we find them as ſetled and inflexible as the Turks, and altogether as groſs and ignorant.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the Acts and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which the Turks preſerve their own Religion; and here it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to take a Tranſitory view of one point of Conduct, by which they ſo much weaken the Chriſtians. They do not make their attempts on it by open Perſecution; this would carry a ſhow of too much Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, and make the Sufferers paſs for Martyrs, which would not only beget Compaſſion in the Spectatours, but a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100786:146"/>
alſo in them, that their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not of a Divine Extraction, which requir'd ſuch bloody Executions for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; from hence naturally would ſpring a Curioſity of enquiring into the Nature, both of one and of the other Religion, which could not but bring over great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Proſelites to the Chriſtian, and which could not but be attended alſo with important Alteration. No no, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed another way, <hi>viz.</hi> by a ſort of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is nothing but a more lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and artificial Cruelty, making Men to taſte gradually that bitterneſs of which a ſudden blow would take away all Senſe, and perhaps all Fears. They ſuffer the Chriſtians, I ſay, to enjoy the Liberty of their Religion; but then by their exactions in Tribute, both of their Children and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, by barring them from all Offices, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Credit or Profit, by remiſneſs of Juſtice on their behalf, and by treating them frequently, with terms of Ignominy and Scorn, and by expoſing them to the right worſhipfull the <hi>Mobb;</hi> they ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate and debaſe their Spirits, as makes them very degenerate, enduing their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated Slavery without reſiſtance; and with ſuch kind of Methods as theſe, ſome of our Europeans are not unacquainted. An open Perſecution is like cutting down a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100786:147"/>
Tree at the Butt, which makes a great noiſe in the fall, and leaves a ghaſtly gap behind; when yet after ſome little time, there ſhall ſprout out innumerable ſhoots and ſuckers from the Roots of the mangled Trunk, which will not be deſtroy'd but with great Labour and Difficulty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other Method is like that of well drawing the Nouriſhment from the Root, and by removing the Earth which covers it, by which means it becomes naked, and lies expos'd to the Extremities of Weather, to Cold, and to the burning Sun, and to all intemperance of the Air, which in ſhort time will make the Tree wither away, or continue in ſuch a languiſhing Condition, as ſhall give but little Umbrage, nor afford any ſhelter under its Branches.</p>
            <p>Having taking a ſhort veiw of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Methods for the defence of their own Religion, the next general conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be that of its Author, as alſo of the Nature and conſideration of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. Its Authour <hi>Mahomet,</hi> an <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelite</hi> by Extraction, and a Nation of <hi>Arabia,</hi> was by profeſſion a Carrier, and being maſter of Camels did follow Traffick, as 'twas the Practice anciently of the <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> or <hi>Arabians,</hi> and is in uſe amongſt them to this very day, in great companies of Mules and Camels, call'd, <hi>Caravans.</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:100786:147"/>
The Impoſture being one of a ſubtle wit, as are generally Men of this Profeſſion and Countrey, ſoon grew Rich and powerfull too: For receiving Pay under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Heraclius</hi> at ſuch time as the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Army revolted; he was not wanting to make his Advantage by heading a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his perfidious Countrymen, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending belike to free his Country from Superſtition and Slavery, and to ſecure their Lives and Properties: By theſe means we may eaſily gueſs that he was Idoliz'd by the <hi>Arabian</hi> Rable, and ſoon became conſiderable. And becauſe pretenſion of Religion has been ever lookt upon as a fair Cloak for Rebellion, and the fitteſt Inſtrument to puzzle the Populace, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour plaid the Zealot, and ſets up for an Enthuſiaſt, or ſome divinely inſpir'd Prophet.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of that Age, as we have always noted, did highly favour his deſign; for we do not find that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity made any entrance into <hi>Arabia,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who ſwarm'd about <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> had ſpread themſelves into theſe parts; as likewiſe the Jews, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Traffick. The Impoſtour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like a true <hi>Trimmer</hi> or <hi>Latitudinarian,</hi> acted the part of a moderate Reconciler, by forging a Religion, or pacifick Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all diſſenting Parties. To gain the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100786:148"/>
Jews, he forbad Swines Fleſh, retain'd Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, aboliſh'd Images, extolls <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and every where magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Old Teſtament. To allure the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians, he magnifies Jeſus Chriſt alſo, allowing him to be ſent from Heaven, and to be conceiv'd on the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom alſo he highly honours and eſteems, as an immaculate Virgin, both before and after her deliverance. He taught alſo, that Jeſus Chriſt came to inſtruct the World, and left it a holy Law or Rule in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or the New Teſtament; and in the laſt place, to draw over the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> to his Belief, he taught that Jeſus Chriſt was not true God, nor the Son of God.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Myſteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion might ſeem hard of digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to new Converts, he expung'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Trinity, as alſo of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt out of his Alcoran. He took no notice likewiſe of the Sacraments, of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Juſtification by the Merits and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, nor of Original Sin, and the like. And to ſecure the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and voluptuous to his party, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd the Doctrines of Chriſt, touching ſelf Denial, of returning Good for Evil, of loving our Enemies, of ſuffering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Perſecutions with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100786:148"/>
and of ſubduing our Paſſions, and of abſtaining from the very thoughts of ſin; in lieu of which ſevere Doctrines, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his Proſelites to have many Wives, and as many Concubines as they could maintain. He allowed them alſo, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded them to be reveng'd of their Enemies, and after this life ended, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them the fruition of Women, brave Ox-ey'd Women, of pleaſant Gardens, and Fruits, with ſuch like Blandiſhments as might prove fuel to their Luſts, in the next life.</p>
            <p>Nor did his Artifice reſt here; for being jealous that his Novelties could not eaſily gain credit upon the ſcore of their own ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, he pretended that all was reveal'd to him by the Angel <hi>Gabriel;</hi> to countenance which Impoſture, his diſeaſe (which was the Falling-ſickneſs) was of wonderfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and we know the time (and God grant we may not know it again) when a black or white Cap, and a Handkerchief knit about the Neck with a Slip not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a hallowed Cough and a twarying Noſe, were the infallible marks of a Son, or rather of a Father of Grace. But to return to <hi>Mahomet</hi> (where we left him) in his fits of Trembling, out of which, as out of a Trance of Ecſtaſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little recover'd, with a ghaſtly, pale, and meigre Countenance, and half diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100786:149"/>
he vented his Blaſphemies and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, in abrupt Sentences, and with a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Voice of denouncing Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſuch as did not fear God and keep his Commandments, which were ſent to them by his Prophet <hi>Mahomet;</hi> by which we may judge readily of what Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Extraction the Quakers are, who (to give them their due) are much ancienter we ſee than many of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Sectaries.</p>
            <p>But we muſt not yet take leave of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> who of a Captain of Mules became a Colonel or Brigadier of Light Horſe, and at laſt a great General, by revolting from his Prince and Maſter; like another <hi>Oliver,</hi> he made uſe of both Swords, the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that of the Spirit; this being the certain Method by which all Uſurpers do advance themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> to join the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer to the Rebel; ſo that had his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the late Uſurper liv'd in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader muſt agree with me in my Opinion, that he would have made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent true <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or had <hi>Mahomet</hi> liv'd in <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, that he would have made as good a Lord Protectour.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Alcoran</hi> or the reveal'd Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it is divided into Chapters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100786:149"/>
certain ridiculous Titles, which have not the leaſt affinity with the Contents, as the Verſes or Sentences of the Contents have not the leaſt Connexion with one another. Every Chapter is prefac'd with the Name of God, all Gracious and Merciful; but for the Contents of them, they are generally the ſame throughout, tending to denounce God's heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Infidels and Sinners, ſpeaking oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Heaven, Hell, and a general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Good Works, ſuch as Alms, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and Prayers, are every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and commanded; upon the whole it is nothing but a Hodg podg of Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the abrupt tranſports of a Frantick Spirit, which though in offenſive many of them in themſelves, and pretending to promote vertue and a good life, yet being ſo often repeated, and without the leaſt connexion of matter, it quickly nauſeates, and carries not the leaſt appearance of a Collection or Body of Laws, being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtuff than what any old intoxicated bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottiſt vents uſually in a religious Fury; ſo that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> may truly be ſaid to be as dry, incoherent, devious and dangerous, as the Sands of <hi>Arabia</hi> in which 'twas hatcht.</p>
            <p>But that we may come nearer to our journeys end through this barren Deſart, let us compare the Life and Doctrine of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100786:150"/>
Jeſus with that of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And here a ſacred horrour puts a kind of ſtop to my Pen, when I offer to compare, I ſay, two things ſo extreme as the holy Jeſus with the moſt impure Impoſtour. But ſince the Beauty of Light may without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be illuſtrated by the gloming Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Darkneſs, and the Goodneſs of God may become more viſible by being oppos'd to the Deformity of the Devil; let us, I ſay, compare theſe two Prophets together.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, for the holy Jeſus, he tells his Followers; That he did not bear record of himſelf, but that the Works which he did teſtifie of him, to which he appeals, and of which we have ſpoken already. <q>As for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> let us hear what he ſays of himſelf: They will certainly cry out (ſays he) that <hi>Mahomet</hi> dream'd and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Alcoran cap of the Prophets</note> what he teacheth; that he is a Poet, and that all is but Fiction; we will not believe him unleſs he ſhew us ſome Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as did the Prophets of Old.</q> To this Objection which <hi>Mahomet</hi> makes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and againſt himſelf we may be ſure, what Anſwer does he give? Why truly, and very wiſely, he lets the Objection even ſhift for it ſelf as well as it can, running on at his old impertinent Career, and crying out; <q>We have deſtroyed many Towns, becauſe its Inhabitants were Incredulous;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100786:150"/>
thoſe which we ſent before thee were Men which were inſpir'd by us; demand of them who were before you, and who liv'd under the written Law, if you are ignorant of it: They were Men who did Eat, Drink, and were Mortal, we have accompliſhed what we promis'd them, and ſav'd them, together with other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and have rooted out the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; we have ſent you a Book to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you, do you not underſtand how many infidel Towns we have deſtroy'd, and how many new Generations have been eſtabliſh'd in their places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a very fair and peſtilent Anſwer to his own Objection, and like the reſt of the Alcoran.</q> There was one Miracle I confeſs father'd on him; how that once upon a Time, the Moon was cleft in twain, and fell down upon the Ground, wereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> ran nimbly, and catching up the Peices before they crumbled into Bits, ſolder'd them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again, and ſent it up to Heaven whole and ſound as a Bell; a Miracle which no Man ſaw beſides the Authour of it, and ſerves only to convince his followers, that he was no other than a Lunatick.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Jeſus Chriſt was a Perſon of a moſt pure and holy Life, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, whilſt <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> owns himſelf in many places of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100786:151"/>
               <hi>Alcoran</hi> to have been a very leud, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and luſtfull Perſon. Thirdly, the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt was this: Love your Enemies, entertain not a luſtfull Thought, ſuffer Reproaches thankfully, rejoice under Perſecutions and the like; the Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is, Kill your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, get as many Wives and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines as you can keep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, the Inſtruments which Jeſus made uſe of to propagate his Doctrine, were a few poor ſimple Fiſhermen, timorous and illiterate, without Friends, Money, or Intereſt: The Inſtrument which <hi>Mahomet</hi> had recourſe to, were Squadrons of Arm'd and Bloody <hi>Arabians.</hi> Fifthly, when Chriſt appear'd, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who oppos'd his Doctrine, were in their greateſt Glory for Learning, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Strength; there was then the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the moſt powerfull Emperour the World ever knew, which made head againſt it; when <hi>Mahomet</hi> appear'd, the Empire was broken to pieces, and the Countrey he appear'd in was utterly void of all Learning, Knowledge, Humility and ſenſe of Chriſtianity, excepting a few Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hereticks. Laſtly, Chriſt promis'd Salvation by dying and riſing again; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> by ſighting, promiſing alſo that he would come again to them a thouſand Years after his departure; but he was not
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100786:151"/>
ſo good as his word; in ſo much that the Mufti, finding the People much diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ready to Mutiny about the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompliſhment of this glorious Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, found this Artifice to appeaſe them; ſaying, That upon a more diligent peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the Sacred Books, he diſcover'd a miſtake in the Figure, and ſo it was found to be 2000 and not 1000 Years before this moſt illuſtrious Propheſie ſhould be full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd; which Cheat, ſo ſilly as it was, was ſufficient to appeaſe the deluded Rabble. From all theſe Inſtances it appears abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; that the great Succeſs in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, had its Birth and Progreſs from humane Artifice and Invention.</p>
            <p>But here the <hi>Mahometan</hi> will reply; if Jeſus Chriſt were the Son of God, and came down from Heaven to Redeem the World from Errour and Eternal Miſery, how comes it to paſs, that he has ſuffer'd ſuch an Impoſtour as <hi>Mahomet</hi> to delude Mankind for above a thouſand Years, raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Spouſe the Church out of his Boſome, and making moſt direfull Butcheries on the Sons and Members of it, inſomuch that there is ſcarce one third left to Chriſt; ſo large and permanent are the acquiſitions of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> From whence 'twill follow; That Chriſt muſt either want Will or
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100786:152"/>
Power to defend that Church, for whoſe ſake 'tis ſaid, that he came down from Heaven, and was incarnate, and ſuffered an Ignominious Death upon the Croſs, and that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as one of greater Power and Vertue to defend his Doctrine, was no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour, but a true and glorious Prophet A Diſcourſe like this, how Blaſphemous and Offenſive ſoever it may be to the Ears of a Chriſtian, muſt yet be ſuffer'd were I to diſpute with a <hi>Mahometan;</hi> and indeed, it is the only thing of moment which any of that Religion can ſuggeſt in favour of it, to which I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the ſame Objection might be made againſt the Jewiſh Church of Old; for they were in compariſon of the Pagan World, not ſo much as one to a thouſand; alſo, they were frequently oppreſs'd by their Neighbours, and at laſt their Laws and Nation in a manner extinguiſh'd in the Babyloniſh Captivity. The Jewiſh Church indeed was a Type of the Chriſtian, and the Caſe the ſame in both: God's promiſes were always Conditional, there being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd Repentance, and Duties on Man's part, for failure whereof ſevere Judgments were ever denounc'd, and thus much <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> himſelf allows every where in his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.</hi> Now that there was ſuch a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decay of Piety and Chriſtian Vertue in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100786:152"/>
theſe People, who now groan under the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Yoke, at ſuch time as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came its Vaſſals, is notoriouſly evident in all Monuments of Antiquity; nor does <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> promiſe Bleſſings and Mercies to his Followers, but upon ſuch Conditions as are before mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Beleif, Repentance, and Good-Works.</p>
            <p>In the next place, that there ſhould be great Apoſtaſies from the Faith, and that there ſhould ariſe great Seducers, and falſe Prophets, or Antichriſts, who ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many, and introduce New and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Doctrines, was what Chriſt foretold, and caution'd thoſe who embrac'd his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to beware of it: ſo that the event, is ſo far from weakning the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that it does fortifie the ſame, by the accompliſhment of what Jeſus fore-told.</p>
            <p>In the third place, ſuch a Breach in the Chriſtian Body, is no diminution of Chriſt's Power and Goodneſs; the Church of Chriſt in this World, is in a ſtate Militant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to continual Fatigues and Dangers, and ſometimes to Defeats, and to Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this is nothing, but what Chriſt alſo foretold in his Goſpel, and what he himſelf ſuffer'd. Now here indeed is the Power and Goodneſs of God made manifeſt, that, maugre all the Barbarity and Artifice of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100786:153"/>
Turkiſh Gorvernment, the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians throughout their Dominions, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of thoſe who hold them in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Nor have the Turks introduc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Greeks any Doctrines of their own, which may poiſon the Chriſtian Faith; ſo that however their Temporal Eſtates may ſuffer by God's wonderfull Providence and Goodneſs, they are not in any ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as to their Souls; all which ſerves to wean Men from the Love of this World, and to ſettle their thoughts upon a future State, which is indeed the grand Scope and Method of the Goſpel: And as this is the Method with the Church in general, ſo likewiſe is it with every true Chriſtian in particular; and although at firſt ſight, it may ſeem ſomething harſh, that Chriſt who came into the World to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and to redeem Men from Sin, ſhould notwithſtanding, ſuffer the ſame Devil to tempt us to ſin, and to raviſh infinite numbers of Souls daily out of the Arms of the Church; yet even in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he verifies his own Doctrine, for Eternal Happineſs is called a Crown<hi>:</hi> Now a Crown or Garland, through all Antiquity, was ever held a Military Reward, ſuch were their Civil, Moral, and other Crowns, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongſt the Ancients; ſo that the very Reward does ſuppoſe a Victory, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100786:153"/>
Victory a Fight, and Fight an Enemy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable hereunto the Apoſtle tells us, that we wraſtle not with Fleſh and Blood, that is, with our own ſenſual Appetites and Paſſions; but with Principalities and Powers, and ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places; that is, with Devils who yet retain ſome kind of Government, and are in Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another, reſembling the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the bleſſed Angels, which are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed alſo by the like Characters of Thrones Dominions, Principalities, and Powers, and are always at hand to relieve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Elect againſt Temporal Dangers, and the Aſſaults of thoſe black Legions, as is every where moſt abundantly reveal'd in Scripture. Now if Men for a corruptible Crown venture ſo much, he certainly does not deſerve one which is Eternal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, who will not ſuffer hardſhip, and combate the Enemies who oppoſe him. Nor has Chriſt left the Members of his Church abandon'd and deſtitute, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the aſſiſtance of the bleſſed Angels, the aſſiſtance of his Sacraments, together with his own Example, Precepts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, he has for our farther Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, promiſs'd us the aſſiſtance of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, to adorn us with many ſingular Graces, and to direct his Church into the way of Truth and Holineſs: To all which,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100786:154"/>
whoſoever has a true regard, and lives a vertuous Life, cannot but have a ſollid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of being eternally happy.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, the progreſs which the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superſtition has made, is not ſo great, as what the Profeſſors of it do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; they never met with any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to diſpute with them, nor Princes to perſecute them; ſo that like Weeds in a fruitfull Soil, being neglected, they ſoon grow up, and over-run the good Ground. What Oppoſition the Chriſtian Religion met with in its Birth and Infancy, we have already ſpoken of; as alſo, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, after all their Calamities, far exceed the <hi>Mahometans</hi> in number throughout all the Grand Signior's Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To put an end to this Diſcourſe, I put it thus to the <hi>Mahometan: Mahomet,</hi> in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alcoran c.</hi> of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> 
                  <hi>Alcoran,</hi> brings in God thus ſpeaking to him: [After many Prophets, we have at laſt ſent Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> he has confirm'd the Ancient Scriptures; We have given him the Goſpel full of Light, to conduct the People into the right way; they who follow the Goſpel, ought to judg how it is taught in the Goſpel; they who do not judge conformably to what God hath taught them, are diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Divine Majeſty.]</q> The like he has in many other places of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:100786:154"/>

               <hi>Mary,</hi> when they boaſted how they had killed the Meſſiah, even Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Apoſtle and Prophet of God. <q>[They did not kill him, nor crucified him; but they crucified another Perſon who reſembled him, God having taken up Jeſus to himſelf into Heaven.]</q> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>in the forecited Chap. of the Table,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Thoſe who ſay, that the Meſſiah the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is God, are impious.</hi> Now let us ſee how theſe Sayings of <hi>Mahomet</hi> can hang together: It is in the Goſpel that we read, how Chriſt <hi>(the Word)</hi> was God, or the Son of the living God; alſo that he was Crucified, and Roſe again: It is in the Goſpel, where we read, that Chriſt taught and commanded his Diſciples, to Baptize all Nations, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; as alſo inſtituted the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and left it as his laſt Legacy or Pledge of his Love before his Tranſlation: Now if the Goſpel, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> tells us, be full of Light, and left us by God, to direct us into the way of Truth, then muſt the forementioned Doctrines alſo be true; for ſhould the Goſpel teach us a Falſhood, it could not be ſaid to be full of Light, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100786:155"/>
to direct us into the way of Truth. Now if theſe Doctrines be true, then muſt that which is taught by <hi>Mahomet</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary be falſe; and conſequently, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> in ſo teaching, is no leſs contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to himſelf, than to the Truth, and was therefore no true Prophet, but a lying and wicked Impoſture.</p>
            <p>But before I take my leave of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it will not be amiſs, to advertiſe my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (if he be a Chriſtian) of the danger, both he and all other Chriſtians are in, of being reduc'd under the Slavery of this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and common Enemy; ſo that how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſoever the Chriſtian Arms are, or have been, we are ſtill in greater danger than ever, of being ruin'd by the Legions of theſe Infidels, not thoſe of their Spahi, or Janizaries, but by thoſe of another Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der far more miſcheivous; foraſmuch as they fight under our own Colors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be of our Party, ſuch Enemies are ever look'd upon as the moſt dangerous; for they are rarely diſcover'd till they have given the Mortal Blow. Now theſe are the <hi>Socinians,</hi> a Sect which, though exploded the World above a thouſand Years ago, under the appellation of <hi>Arians,</hi> are in theſe our days riſen again from the Grave, and like <hi>Spectrums</hi> appear every where in the Dark. In denying therefore the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100786:155"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, they do with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> not only deny the Trinity, the Doctrine of Juſtification, or the Merits of Chriſt's Satisfaction, but alſo Baptiſm in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, together with the Doctrine of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin. So many fatal Errours do fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low one upon the Neck of another, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that one Fundamental Truth which Chriſt himſelf is pleas'd to call the Baſis of his Church, <hi>viz.</hi> That glorious confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter, Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> we all know are a Mungril Brood, half Chriſtians half Turks, and for this Reaſon 'tis that they ſwarm ſo much in <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and are found at this day to fight openly for the Creſcent againſt the Croſs. This Argument is too great and weighty to be diſcours'd upon under the Method I am engag'd to, it would require a Volume; though we cannot but hope, that as the Pens of pious and learned Men, will not be wanting to purſue and ſtab their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; ſo the Sword of the Magiſtrate, will not fail to find out their Perſons.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of the Immortality of the Soul.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Immortality of Man's Soul is a point of high concernment, and comes next to be conſider'd of; for as much as all our reliance upon God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Order, as alſo all the hopes and rewards which depend upon our Faith with whatſoever elſe relates to our Chriſtian Practice, are all built upon this Perſuaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul of Man which is the Principle or Source of all his Actions, is of an incorruptible Nature, and ſurvives the Body.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed to Proof, 'tis neceſſary to clear ſome doubts which ſeem to obſtruct us in the Proſecution of this Argument. The firſt grand difficulty is from the Old Teſtament, for if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul be ſo great a Truth, and ſo neceſſary to be believ'd, how comes it to paſs we find no mention of it in all the Jewiſh Writers of Old. In all the Books of the Old Teſtament, there is no place to be found where there is ſo much as mention made of the Kingdom of Heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> after Death. Had the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100786:156"/>
Patriarchs and Prophets believ'd any ſuch thing, they muſt needs have mention'd it ſome time or other, as being a thing of the greateſt concern to them, and the beſt ſupport againſt the Misfortunes of the World and the Terrour of Death. And above all, <hi>David</hi> muſt needs have taken notice of it, having ſuch frequent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given him for it from the whole courſe and variable occurrences of his life. Nay, even at his Death, his Diſcourſes with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> were very copious about ſetling the Temporal Affairs of his Kingdom, but not a Word of the place where he was going to; nor do we find that <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moſes, Samuel</hi> or any of the Patriarchs and Prophets to whom God ſo largely and familiarly reveal'd his Will, ever touch'd upon this important point at the hour of their Death; only we read, that they ſlept with their Fathers, and were gather'd to their People, and there was an end. And though we read oft times of the Soul, and of Hell in the Old Teſtament; yet 'tis plain, that by Hell is underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Death, or the Grave; as by the Soul alſo is underſtood no more but the animal Life, and ſometi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es the Heart and Affections. A Reſurrection of the Body is indeed mention'd by <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> but that's another point; but no proof can be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100786:157"/>
produc'd which ſpeaks of the Soul as of an immaterial and ſpiritual ſubſtance, ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Death.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſo ſilent touching the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but that there is ground enough, even from Scripture, to make the matter dubious. For moſt Divines are of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that 'twas <hi>Samuel</hi>'s real Soul which God ſuffer'd the Witch to raiſe the Night before <hi>Saul</hi>'s Death, which could not be, had it not ſurviv'd the Body. And even in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> (which Book ſeems even in a manner to determine Man's felicity in Temporal Enjoyments,) upon the ſumm of the matter, we are told by <hi>Solomon,</hi> that the Body ſhall return to the Duſt, but the Spirit to God that gave it: though much either way cannot be concluded from the Paſſages of this Book, which ſeems to be no other than a Collection of Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by <hi>Solomon,</hi> under his two Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, Natural and Divine; or a Miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Aphoriſms, as they were dictated by the Natural Man and Wiſdom. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, this is certain; that if the Books of <hi>Tobit</hi> and of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> be of any Credit with us, (as I know not but they ſhould,) there is enough for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, being told <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. and 3. of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that God created Man to be Immortal, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100786:157"/>
that the Souls of the Righteous are in the hands of God, and there ſhould no Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touch them; and a little after, he ſays, that though they be puniſh'd in the ſight of Men, yet is their Hope full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. <hi>Tobit</hi> alſo in his Prayer, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. deſires of God, that he might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd out of his Diſtreſs, and go into the everlaſting place.</p>
            <p>In the next place, 'tis notwithſtanding probable that God thought fit to conceal the clear knowledge of this, as alſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Important Myſteries of Religion, ſuch as the Doctrine of the Trinity, and of the Incarnation, with ſome Truths of this Nature, from the Generality of the Jews, to render the Preaching of the Goſpel more glorious, by the new Diſcoveries it was to bring along with it, and this is what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us expreſly, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> c. 1. <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt had aboliſh'd Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Goſpel; though 'tis pious alſo to believe, That many of the Holy Patriarchs and Prophets under the Moſaical Inſtitution, had ſome ſecret dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Light, even by the Shadows it reflected. Their wandrings in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs repreſented their Inſtability, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and Errours of Life, all which were to end in <hi>Caanan,</hi> the place of everlaſting
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100786:158"/>
Reſt. Their Jubelees alſo, and Sabbaths, were Types alſo of the ſame Everlaſting Reſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> fully ſhews, <hi>Hebr. the</hi> 4th, where he proves alſo, that the promiſed Reſt, was not that which <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave them in <hi>Caanan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther yet, 'tis not improbable that God ſhould conceal this Important Truth from the Jewiſh Fathers, to the end their Faith might be more Illuſtrious; for the leſs of Evidence, the greater is the Excellence of Faith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> purſues at large through the 11th <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble Acts of Faith, recorded of the Jewiſh Worthies, and particularly of the Patriarchs he expounds it, that they ſaw the Promiſes a far off, and that they were only as Strangers and Pilgrims upon the Earth, ſeeking another Country which was heavenly. Now if they who had but ſuch a ſaint glimmering or dawning of a future State, ſhould live in ſuch a conſtant depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God's Providence, with ſuch exactneſs of Moral Juſtice, and with ſuch indifference for the Things of this Life, in reſpect of God's Commands, was a thing infinitely more Noble, than if they had had future Rewards within a near proſpect; for then Self-Intereſt might ſeem to have been their Motive, whereas now all their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was reſolv'd into the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100786:158"/>
of their Almighty Sovereign; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith is ſo highly recommended to us in this Chapter: For in his readineſs to ſacrifice his Son, he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrific'd all the Affections of Nature, and the conſiderations even of his Reaſon, in his chearfull compliance with God's Commands. Many are the noble Acts of Faith recorded of theſe famous Men of old, who yet received not the Promiſes, God having provided ſome better things for us, that they without us, ſhould not be made perfect.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Doctrine of the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality being taught by Jeſus Chriſt, and the divine Authority of Jeſus Chriſt being evidently deduc'd from the Writings of the Old Teſtament, it follows alſo, that this Doctrine was therein contain'd, as to its Cauſes, like as an Embryo in the Womb, which though inviſible for a while, was in its due time to be brought forth, and be made manifeſt to the World.</p>
            <p>Another Objection from Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Immortality of the Soul, may be grounded upon that Paſſage of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the 9th, whereby God ſpeaking of Man ſaid, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 9th.</note> 
               <hi>Surely the Blood of your Lives will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, at the Hand of every Beaſt will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it,</hi> &amp;c. what our Tranſlation renders <hi>Life,</hi> is by the Vulgar rendred <hi>Soul,</hi> or the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100786:159"/>
Blood of your Souls, and therefore <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the Life or Soul of all Fleſh, is the Blood thereof;</hi> and for that Reaſon 'twas that Blood was prohibited, as being the Life or Soul of every living Creature. Now if the Life or Soul be the Blood, or in the Blood, (as the Phraſe is us'd promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,) it follows; that proportionably to the effuſion of Blood, the Soul alſo is effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and conſequently diviſible and Mortal.</p>
            <p>To this 'tis anſwer'd, that Scripture Phraſes are not to be taken according to the ſtrict Notions of Philoſophy, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apprehenſions and cuſtomary Speech of thoſe they are directed to: For ſo it is, that whilſt we ſee Life departing leiſurely upon the effuſion of Blood, we ſay commonly, that the Soul departeth with it, foraſmuch as the Spirits which are the great Inſtruments of the Soul, are recruited by the Blood, which upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo may be ſaid to be the Vehicle of Life, but cannot be ſaid to be Life it ſelf, but in an improper ſenſe; for though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Evacuation of the Blood, the Soul or Life departeth, ſo the Soul or Life may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part alſo, the Blood ſtill remaining in the Body without any notable diminution or alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:100786:159"/>
The next Prejudice againſt the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul is grounded upon the Birth, Growth, Progreſs, and Decays we obſerve uſually of its operations conformable to the ſeveral Stages of Life. Reaſon we ſee does begin to diſcloſe it ſelf in Child-hood; and although ſome Men have a greater ſhare of it than others, yet upon the main, it ſeems to borrow its Improvements from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Tempers and Diſpoſitions of Men, and the ſeveral Methods of Education; nay ſome Countries have an Influence upon the Genius's of Men more than others, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to more Man-like and regular Thoughts, and render them quicker Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſubtle. If the Soul of Man were endow'd naturally with ſuch excellent Gifts, why does it not manifeſt the ſame without ſo much cultivation and Expenſe; without ſo much diligence and ſtudy? and as faſt as we acquire the knowledg of ſome things, we forget others; ſo that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Mind, are rather the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Art than of Nature. We ſee alſo, when the Body is moſt Athletick, the Mind alſo is moſt vigorous; and as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy decays by Age or Sickneſs, ſo the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Soul languiſh alſo, and by all the Experiments we can make, are totally ſuppreſs'd by Death. Beſides, if the Soul of Man were Immortal, how comes it to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100786:160"/>
paſs, that it has naturally ſuch a horrour of Death; whereas it ſhould rather rejoice at its approach, as the only means of its deliverance from that Obſcurity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint it is ſubject to in the Body, from which being once releas'd, 'tis ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a perfect and unchangable State of Bliſs.</p>
            <p>To the latter part of this Objection 'tis anſwer'd; that the Fears which ſeize uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on dying Men, is the beſt Argument in the World to prove the Soul's Immortality: For dying Men could never have ſuch a fear, had they not Apprehenſions of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, as alſo of its Duration and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability; ſo that theſe Conſiderations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incident to Men of all Conditions, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Countries, and Perſwaſions, prove ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that they are inherent and natural to the Soul, as Gravity, Levity, and ſuch like Inclinations of Bodies, do demonſtrate there is another Region without them, to which they naturally tend; were the Soul of Man as well as his Body extinguiſhable by Death, to dye would be no more, than to cloſe up all the Labours of a tedious Life, in one found and eternal Sleep; a thing which all Men naturally would rather co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet than abhor: But when a departing Soul feels an inward Agony, and labours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Hopes and Fears, it ſhews it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100786:160"/>
towards a future ſtate of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Woe, the apprehenſion whereof, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but fill it with ſome amazement and diſtraction.</p>
            <p>As to the other part of this Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Powers of the Soul, do riſe and fall proportionably to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Delays of Nature, therefore they muſt periſh with it: I anſwer, this does by no means follow. A Candle burns brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or dimmer, as the Glaſs or Lanthorn which contains it is more clear or cloudy, and yet the Light would not be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, though the brittle Caſe were broken; but on the contrary, it would appear with a fuller Luſtre, and diffuſe its Beams with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confinement. When we ſee one of thoſe floating Caſtles of the Sea proudly ſailing; when we obſerve how eaſily 'tis turn'd about, and how regular it is in all its Motions, and yet of that force, as to reſiſt the bluſtring Winds, and the raging Ocean, we are eaſily perſuaded, that there is ſome one within who animates this great and curious Machine, who though he be no part or Member of the ſame, yet all the Effects he works, depend upon the good diſpoſition and frame of the Ship; for if it be old, leaky, or any way diſabled in the Hulk, Rigging, or any of its ſubſervient Inſtruments; the Pilot though never ſo
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100786:161"/>
knowing, will appear very defective in all his Endeavours; nay, though the Pilot knows himſelf to be of a more durable and excellent Frame than the Veſſel which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him, yet he fears a Wreck, and labours what he can to ſave his Ship from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions he has of the uncertain State to which he ſhall be expos'd, when the Veſſel which now covers him, ſhall fall to pieces; how appoſite this Emblem is, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate our preſent Argument, is obvious to all.</p>
            <p>As to the Operations of Man's Soul, I confeſs much muſt be allow'd to the force and Methods of Education, and to the Temper of the Climate in which Men live; and yet we may obſerve, that the groſſeſt Peaſants have naturally all theſe Gifts, which the wiſeſt Men by all their Arts and Study can arrive to. The labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Husbandman, though he cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Dimenſions, Beauty, and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heavens, underſtands well enough the Criticiſms of every Seaſon, and knows alſo the Virtue and Temper of the Earth, he cultivates much better than the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Philoſopher, and accordingly takes his Proſpect, and makes his profitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns; he is cautious and ſubtle in making his little Bargains, as the greateſt Stateſman can pretend to be in his Contracts and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100786:161"/>
Meaſures of Government; and what is yet more obſervable, as he has a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Providence, ſo naturally he ſhews a greater ſubmiſſion to the Will of Heaven, and bears his Loſſes and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with greater patience, than thoſe who have been ſtudied in the Schools of Vertue; ſo that much ſtill is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Genius and Fabrick of the Soul, the natural Source of all his Actions.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve alſo of many Bruits, that they are endued with a natural Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, great Docility, and with a greater quickneſs of Senſe, than what any Man can pretend to, and yet one who is born Deaf, and conſequently Dumb, though he be thus defective in that Senſe of Hearing, which is ſo eſſentially requiſite for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Underſtanding, and by which all Inſtruction finds a Paſſage to the Soul; I ſay ſuch a Man by the help of Art, (as daily Experience does evince in Mutes,) may be brought to have an accurate and correct Conception of things, to be moſt apprehenſive of what is ſaid or done, and by the leaſt Hints and Motions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to underſtand the Minds of thoſe he does converſe with, and by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary quickneſs in the motion of his Hands and Eyes, to communicate his own Thoughts; a thing which Bruits though
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100786:162"/>
never ſo ſubtil and prone to Imitation, and though moſt accute and attentive in all their Senſes, and though inſtructed with the greateſt diligence, can never arrive to in any degree conſiderable; which ſhews ſufficiently, that there is a vaſt difference betwixt the Nature and Capacity of the Animal, and thoſe of the Rational Soul.</p>
            <p>That force of Judgment and Reaſon; which we obſerve frequently in Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the decays of Nature, whether by Age, or Sickneſs, is not, I confeſs, ſuch a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Proof of ſuch a perfection of the Soul, as is now diſcours'd of; ſince we find that even habits of Exerciſe, acquir'd in our younger Years, as of Dancing, or Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal performances, continue to ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree in Men, maugre all the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions and Decays of the Body; much more then may thoſe Habits of the Mind, which were acquir'd by Diſcipline and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, continue vigorous in a languiſhing Conſtitution, though they were admitted to ſpring from an Elementory mixture. But for all this, we may frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in dying Men, ſome ſudden Sallies and Tranſports of Joy, ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Efforts of Mind, which were not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Education; and above all, in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children, whoſe tender Age never yet arriv'd to any ſuch Inclinations, we may
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100786:162"/>
oftentimes obſerve ſtrange Illuminations, and quietneſs of Spirit, a little before their departure, which, I ſay, can never proceed from what they never yet acquir'd, but from the innate Propenſities and Genius of the Soul.</p>
            <p>But whatſoever that dependence be, which the Soul has upon the Body, and though it ſhould be granted, that it receiv'd all its Improvements from it, yet this is no Argument againſt the future and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent State of the Soul after death. An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo we ſee, is form'd and nouriſh'd by the Womb, and yet when the juſt appointed time for its departure happens, it is ſo far from ceaſing to be what it was before, that it acquires a nobler Degree of Life, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from its Matrix, and arrives to the perfection of a living Creature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Senſe, which before only was of a vegetative Nature; ſo it is with the Soul, which though nouriſh'd or cheriſh'd by the Miniſtry of theſe Corporeal Organs, when once it is deliver'd from them, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes yet a higher degree of Perfection and Life, and is capable to ſubſiſt and act of it ſelf, by Methods far more Noble and Spiritual, than thoſe by which it was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, when it was in, Union with the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:100786:163"/>
Having thus given a ſummary Reply to ſuch Obſervations, as ſeem'd moſt prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Soul's Immortality; let us now proceed to prove this Doctrine by ſuch natural Medicines, as ſhall yet give farther ſatisfaction to the foregoing Doubts, as well as eſtabliſh the truth of our preſent Aſſertion. Now the general Arguments by which this Truth is demonſtrable, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, 1. From the Operations of the Soul. 2. From the natural Inclinations of the Soul. 3. From the Juſtice of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And laſtly, from the Teſtimonies of the wiſeſt Heathens.</p>
            <p>Firſt as to the Operations of the rational Soul, though the firſt Rudiments we have of things, be borrowed from the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made upon our outward Senſes, yet the Reductions and Inferences we make of things (which are the Works properly of Reaſon) are of a much ſublimer Nature; ſo that the Organs to Senſe, are but like the Candles to the Soul, which diſcover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Object in ſome reſpect, whilſt the diſcerning Faculties, is of an extraction far more ſpiritual and pure. With what fixt and conſtant Applications does the Mind of Man bend it ſelf with all its Inſtruments upon its Object, and through how many Labyrinths of Doubts, and ſeeming Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions does it wind it ſelf in the purſuit
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100786:163"/>
of it, whether it be matter of Judgment and Practice, or of Speculation only and Knowledg? With what order, ſilence, and readineſs does every Faculty ſtand prepar'd, how quick and diligent are they in their Reports, and how capacious and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable is the Mind in receiving them? Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation never wearies it, though the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Powers grow tir'd often, and require repoſe. What an infinite variety of Objects occurr to the Mind at once, what number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Idea's and Images of things hover al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways over it, and how quick are its tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from one thing to another, ſeeming, as it were, in one Point or Inſtant of time, to view all Perſons, Things, and Places, which ever made an impreſſion upon the Senſe! The Mind paſſes in a moment from the dark Centre of the Earth, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſurface of the World, and there ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys this vaſt Fabrick: From thence it flies through that immenſe or imaginary ſpace, which is incomprehenſible and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and which ſurrounds the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It fathoms the Nature of Things, ſo that whatſoever has an Exiſtence falls under its conſideration; it does not only take in preſent and paſt Things, but it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its Power to future Objects, whether poſſible, or ſuch as really ſhall come to paſs; and by a juſt balancing of what is paſt,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100786:164"/>
with what may happen, it frames excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rules for the government of Life; it leaves us Precepts alſo, how to moderate our Paſſions by a right uſe of them; and by theſe means, teaches us the Divine Art of Wiſdom, and true Felicity.</p>
            <p>How many Conceptions are there, which hourly offer themſelves to our Thoughts, when we retreat a little within our ſelves? Of theſe ſome are ſimple Apprehenſions only of particular things; others by way of Compoſition, are the reſults of divers Images, amidſt which great multiplicity, ſome there are which at the firſt ſight ſeem plauſible and attractive, which yet upon farther examination of Reaſon, are found to be ſuperficial only and fallacious: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again ſeem abſtruſe and uſeleſs, which upon a ſtrict Enquiry, are found to be moſt beneficial and ſollid; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are committed to the Store-houſes, or ſeveral Apartments of Memory, there to be conſerv'd and reveiw'd at leiſure, and to be produc'd for ſervice towards our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquiſition of Knowledg, or for our better conduct in the Occurrences and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Life; all which Conceptions and Inferences of Reaſon are of that vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and of that ſpiritual and ſubtil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as cannot but tell us, that their Spring is pure and inexhauſtible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:100786:164"/>
Contemplation is another intellectual Act of a Rational Soul, and indeed the higheſt and moſt Seraphick; for by this the Mind is elevated above all ſenſible Forms, and many times deſerts the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, it ſeems to break Priſon, and feels an ineffable Agility and Pleaſure in being unconfin'd, whilſt the Body lies ſenſeleſs, and as it were inchanted with the ſoft Chains of Sleep. And when the Mind recovers it ſelf out of the Ecſtaſie in which all the inferiour Powers are ſometimes drown'd, what languors are there in the Soul, what ſtruglings to return to the ſame ſtate of ſeparation, whilſt it nauſeats all earthly Objects whatſoever; which ſhews that the Soul thirſts after another State, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent on the Body, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt ſurvive it.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, if we reflect a little upon the Will, the other great Faculty of a humane Soul, we ſhall find its Operations to be ſo free and magiſterial, as cannot but tell us, that the Soul, of which it is a Branch, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent on all Animal Inclinations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for ſo it is, that we have a Power of Election and of Rejection of Objects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary all the dictates of Senſe and Paſſion. We ſee every day how Men chooſe Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment rather than Liberty, Poverty and Diſgrace rather than Wealth and Honour;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100786:165"/>
and even Death it ſelf rather than Life, and can bid an eternal Adieu to all ſenſual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments which Nature can induce them to, and all upon future Conſiderations; ſo that the current of voluntary Actions, mounts much higher we ſee than the Level of Nature, and muſt iſſue therefore from a higher Spring: Therefore Conſcience, which is nothing but that Impartial Judgment, which every Man makes within the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of his own Breaſt, by reflecting on what he has done, or on what he is about to do; how quick and impartial is it in recalling on Memory ſuch things, as many times we would willingly forget; how inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it in condemning the Man himſelf, and how ſevere in inflicting condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, more powerfull, than all the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Rack, and of the longeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and as ghaſtly as the Horrors of Hell, being ſuch as no Methods of Reaſon, no Arts of Education, no Charms of Senſe, no Worldly Fruition, no Spirits of Wine, no Phyſick, no good Company, nor Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and finally no Decays of Body can lay a Sleep; and on the other hand, when a Man has the Teſtimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience on his ſide, though he expects no Rewards from the World; nay, though he expect Diſcomforts, as alſo loſs of Friends, Liberty, Eſtate and good Name, and even
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100786:165"/>
of life it ſelf, how does he rejoice within; with what chearfull Countenance does he meet the Menaces of Fortune, and in the midſt of Tempeſts finds ſerenity. Now whence can this proceed but from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions the Soul has of a future Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it muſt undergo after Death, which cannot be, were the Soul Material and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
            <p>With theſe, and infinite other things, is the Mind continually employ'd without Obſtacle or Danger, without Reſt or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; ſo that when all the Senſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Body are actually ſuſpended as in Sleep, yet is the Soul ſtill vigilant and active, which ſhews plainly, that 'tis of a Nature far more durable and perfect than any Animal Capacity whatſoever; whether Dreams be an effect of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Faculty or of the Mind rather, is not yet determin'd, 'tis more probable that they are deriv'd from the latter. 'Tis true, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes which we ſeem to make whilſt we are a ſleep, how rational ſoever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to Men in this Circumſtance, are found very trivial, and many times ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous when our Senſes are full a wake; yet this proves not that theſe Thoughts of the Night are deriv'd from ſome other Principle inferiour to the Mind; it being moſt evident, that the groſs Conceits, with
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100786:166"/>
which the thoughts of ſleeping Men are fill'd, are nothing but the Operations of the Soul, deprav'd and clouded with ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours as fill the Brain in the time of Sleep, and which do not only ſuffocate the Senſes for a time, but by their ſpiſſous fumes fill all the Bells of this upper Region of the Mind; ſo that all its Operations receive a kind of fuliginous Tincture from them. And hence we find alſo, that in Men who are perfectly awake, and whoſe Brains are fill'd with aduſt and ſcorching Vapours, (as in a Fever, and many other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,) all the Actions of the Mind ſeem like Dreams, and all Objects occurr to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy full of Terrour, Agony and Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of thoſe burning Particles which fume from diſtemper'd Blood.</p>
            <p>The ſecond general Argument for the Soul's Immortatily, is drawn from its Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations, which are ſuch as are ſtill aſpiring towards higher degrees of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Mind is never ſatiated with Knowledge, but ſtill thirſts after new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries; our perception of one thing does naturally lead us into the enquiry of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which having once obtained, our Soul takes a farther proſpect ſtill, till at length being arriv'd to the firſt origine of all things, it dwells on it, and enquires alſo into the Nature and Perfections of it,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100786:166"/>
as far as its own limits will allow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be united with it for ever. Now this ſhews ſufficiently, that in this life 'tis only in a tendency to that Perfection and Reſt, which cannot be attain'd to but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The deſcending ſtone, if any thing obſtruct its Motion, does by its reſiſting weight tell us, that by Nature it would go farther, and the nearer it comes to its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, it preſſes ſtill with greater weight, and, if no obſtacle occurr, it is ſtill more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous in its Motion, till it falls at laſt to that point of Reſt from which 'twill not be remov'd, but with greater difficulty. In like manner we obſerve alſo, how the Flame mounts upwards, and the more pure and ſubtile 'tis, the quicker in its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſtill encreaſes, the higher it riſes, till at laſt 'tis ſwallow'd up and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in that immenſe Region of <hi>Aether,</hi> to which it was deſign'd by Nature. Thus fares it with the Soul of Man, which does enlarge its deſires far beyound the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life; the more tis fill'd, the greater ſtill is its appetite, which diſcovers plainly that it is not yet arriv'd to its place of Reſt; but is only in the way towards it, which ſince it can never find whilſt it is in union with the Body; it remains that there muſt be a future State, where it ſhall meet with a ſuitable content, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100786:167"/>
be, unleſs the Soul by Nature were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and Immortal. So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall but make a Reflection upon himſelf, and conſider the Frame and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his own Mind, muſt needs obſerve it to be of a Nature more active and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than Fire, and more quick and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating than Lightning, and as to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Power moſt capacious, and ſuch as Labour cannot exhauſt, nor Age make feeble: On the contrary, the longer it endures, it ſtill grows more Vigorous, and requires ſomething more than finite to fills its Dimenſions, from all which we may well conclude, that 'tis of a Spiritual and Angelick Nature, and ſuch as muſt ſurvive all the decays and changes of the Body.</p>
            <p>And indeed, were it corruptible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, it muſt be ſome of theſe ways; Firſt, by the Action of its Contrary, as we ſee mixt Bodies are corrupted by ſome Exceſs or Irregularity in their firſt qualities, which interchequing with one another, cauſe a diſſolution; but this cannot be the caſe of the Soul, which is of a Nature moſt pure and unmixt. Another way by which things are deſtroy'd, is by Diviſion and Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its parts; thus by daily experience we ſee, how things Natural and Artificial are always waſted and broke to peices; but
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100786:167"/>
the Soul being without Extenſion of parts, cannot be diſſolv'd by diviſibility. A third way by which we obſerve Bodies to periſh, is by a deficiency of their Aliment; thus a Tree dies for want of Moiſture, and a Lamp is extinguiſh'd for want of Oyl to feed it; but 'tis not ſo with the Soul of Man, for though it ſubſiſt in the Body, as the flame of a Lamp in the Viol, yet has it not its Illumination from it. 'Tis true, it receives many Informations by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Organs of the Senſes; but theſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being ſimple and common, bear no Analogy to the workings of the Mind; beſides, we find the Soul ſubſiſting and acting when all ſenſitive aſſiſtence is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn. That then, on which the Mind of Man feeds and improves it ſelf, is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of Objects, whether viſible or intellectual, which we meet with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, both in Heaven and Earth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe noble Speculations and Concluſions of Reaſon, which though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a few naked Notions, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being multiplied into as great a number as that of Words, which yet are but the Productions of a few ſimple and Alphabetick Sounds, variouſly mixt and ſet together. Now ſince the Multitude and greatneſs of mental Objects can never be exhauſted by the Soul, it follows, that the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100786:168"/>
Soul of Man can never periſh through want of a ſuitable Aliment and Supply; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all ſenſible and material things cannot ſo properly be ſaid to periſh as to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by being chang'd into ſomething of another Nature; which Tranſmutation or Corruption of things is at the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a reſolution of them into their Elements, from whoſe implace new bodies do riſe; but the Soul of Man is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all ſuch Alterations. It is not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable into any Elements, as being of a Nature more unmixt and pure than any Element whatſoever; it is not changeable into another Soul, or capable of being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than what it is, but by Annihilation; which yet is not conſiſtent with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, who having once created a thing, is never known to have reduc'd it to its firſt nothing.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as the third General Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the Immortality of the Soul is yet farther demonſtrable from the Juſtice of God's Providence. We have obſerv'd in the precedent Chapters, that as to the Comforts and Bleſſings of this Life, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men generally have the upper hand, whilſt Innocent and Vertuous Perſons are oft-times expos'd to unjuſt Sentences, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Oppreſſion, Torments, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, Confiſcation of Goods, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100786:168"/>
ſometimes to Death it ſelf. How many a poor and honeſt Chriſtian is there in the World, who ſuffers by Sickneſs, Cold, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and all courſes of Poverty, and yet lives always in an humble Reſignation of his Will to that of Almighty God, and is thankfull too for the ſmall Comforts of life he receives from him by the Miniſtry of his own laborious Hands; whilſt ſome rich Glutton lies Batning amidſt his Wealth, and ſwelling with Pride and Fatneſs of Bread abandons himſelf to eaſe, and all manner of diſorders, both of Body and Mind: Whoſe Religion indeed conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in having ſome young formal Chaplain for State, rather than for Devotion, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Equipage defective, unleſs he has ſome one in the Eccleſiaſtick Livery to wait upon him. Now how theſe and infinite ſuch Indecencies can conſiſt with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God's Providential Government, is a difficulty which can never be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, were there not a Future State, where unfortunate Vertue ſhould be crown'd, and proſperous wickedneſs be chaſtis'd; which yet can never be, unleſs the Soul of Man ſurvive the Miſeries and Diſſolution of the Body. The Truth of it is, take away the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality, and we deſtroy all Morality; For, morally ſpeaking, who would deny his Soul the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100786:169"/>
Contents and Pleaſures of his Appetite, were all Felicity determin'd in ſenſual and preſent Enjoyments? Who would ſcruple to enrich himſelf by Fraud, Robbery, and Murder, or to gratifie his Luſts by Rapes, Adultery, or any other Enormity, were he ſure there were no Puniſhnent to be met with after Death? The conſequence of which diſorders could be no leſs than the ſubverſions of all Property and Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe and ſuch like Conſiderations we may in the laſt place obſerve, that the wiſeſt and moſt learned Men through all Ages and Countries of the World, believ'd the Soul's Immortality, ſuch as <hi>Hermes;</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who by the few Fragments <note place="margin">Hermes in Paenrand. cap. 1.</note> that are extant of him in Ancient Writers, was of the ſame Belief. <hi>Socrates</hi> at his Death adher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to this Belief alſo, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Strength and Malignity of his Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by this Antidote; that his Soul ſhortly ſhould enjoy the Society of the Vertuous and Bleſſed in the other World. This Doctrine was much improv'd by <hi>Plato</hi> and his Followers, eſpecially <hi>Platinus,</hi> who was the moſt learned of that Sect, and who wrote <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> divers learned Books up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Argument; the ſumm of which is, that the Soul of Man is not deriv'd from the Nature of the Parents, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100786:169"/>
from God; that though it ſubſiſt in the Body, yet its Operations are independent on it: Foraſmuch as the Soul, the more it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws it ſelf from all ſenſible Objects, the more diſtinct and clear is Ratiocination. From whence we conclude, that when it ſhall totally be ſeparated, it ſhall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things in an inſtant by Intuition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helps of reaſoning; by Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nothing but a Combat of the Mind, to evince ſomething of which it doubts, which doubtings ſpring from the groſs and cloudy Suggeſtions and Obſtacles of the Body, from which being once deliver'd, there will be no place left for Doubt and Heſitation.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> their Doctrine ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead them to a different perſuaſion, ſince they plac'd all the Felicity of Man in the Practice of Vertue, with regard to no other reward: So that our Moral Actions ceaſing, (as certainly they do after Death,) all is at an end. And this Doctrine of theirs, though it carried with it a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of noble Sentiments, yet it failing in the true end of Man's Felicity, it oblig'd them to maintain a great number of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes in its defence; whereas had they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Immortality of the Soul, and future Rewards after Death, that had been ſufficient to have ſupported them in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100786:170"/>
courſe of life, maugre all the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that might aſſault them, and which theſe Philoſophers endeavour'd to oppoſe, by ſo many noble Precepts of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>Seneca</hi> in ſome places ſeems du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, yet in his Conſolatory Epiſtle to <hi>Mercia,</hi> upon the Death of his Son, he is altogether Divine. <hi>Epictetus</hi> alſo, a <hi>Stoick,</hi> and the Glory of his Sect and Age, aſſerts every where the Soul's Immortality.</p>
            <p>But above all, <hi>Tully,</hi> the Flower of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Tuſcul. Quaeſ. lib. 1.</note> Eloquence, and himſelf a Philoſopher of <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, is every where moſt Copious and Raviſhing, when he comes to ſpeak of the Capacities and Future State of the Soul. <q>Many (ſays he) think the Eternity of Souls to be incredible, becauſe they cannot comprehend the eſſence and qualities of a ſeparated Soul; but can they (let me ask them) define what a Soul is even in the Body, of what form it is, what its dimenſions are, and what is the place of its abode? (And a little after) for my own part, when I ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Nature of the Soul, it ſeems to be much more difficult and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to know what the Soul is, whilſt it is in Conjunction with the Body, where it ſeems to be lodg'd, as in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Inn, than to underſtand the ſame when it quits the Lodging in which it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100786:170"/>
ſojourns, and takes its Journey home-wards to Heaven, the place of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Habitation<hi>:</hi> For if we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which we never ſaw, we may as well diſown all knowledge of God as of a ſeparated Soul; but Spirits are to be underſtood and known only by Spirits: And by and by he concludes, whatſoever that thing is which perceives, which underſtands, which wills, which is always Vigorous and Maſculine, muſt needs be Celeſtial and Divine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eternal; for we can form no other Notions of God, but as of a Mind ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all material Concretion; underſtanding all things, moving all things, and being it ſelf ended with an Eternal Activity: All which the ſame Divine Oratour proſecutes moſt copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in his Book <hi>de Senectute;</hi> telling us, that it was not the Itch of Diſputation which drew him to this Perſuaſion, but having built his Belief upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares farther, that ſuch is the celerity of the Soul's Thoughts, ſo great its Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of paſt, and foreſight of future things; ſo many are its Arts, Sciences, and other Inventions, that 'tis inpoſſible that the Nature which comprehends ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, ſhould be Mortal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100786:171"/>
ſince the Mind is always a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and has this principle of Motion from it ſelf, and knows alſo no period of its Motion; becauſe it can never divide from it ſelf, and ſerve the nature of the Soul, is void of all Mixture and Allay, and contains nothing heterogenious to it ſelf; he concludes, that it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible and uncapable of Diſſolution, following (as he ſays) the Doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> in this particular. To Conclude, he ſays, that if I do err in this Belief of the Soul's Immortality, I do err willfully, nor will I ever retract this beloved Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour whilſt I live; or if it ſhould be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that being dead, I ſhould be void of all ſenſe, (as ſome Minute Sophiſters do fancy,) I ſhall not fear to be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was this Doctrine of the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality the conſtant Belief of the wiſeſt <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> only, but alſo of the <hi>Perſians</hi> too, as appears by the excellent Diſcourſe of dying <hi>Cyrus</hi> upon this ſubject, recorded by <hi>Xenophon.</hi> And as for the Poets, they univerſally tell us of a future State after Death, wherein the Wicked ſhall be puniſh'd, and the Juſt rewarded; and what their ſenſe was in this matter we may read in <hi>Lucan,</hi> in that noble Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he makes of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Apotheoſis.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100786:171"/>
From all which Conſiderations we have a moſt undeniable proof of its Eternal Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It being impoſſible that a Doctrine eſtabliſhed upon all the Principles of Reaſon, of ſuch an univerſal conſent, and believ'd by the wiſeſt, beſt, and moſt learned Men of all Ages, in oppoſition to all humane Intereſts, and ſenſual Suggeſtions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould be the effect only of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conjecture, or of a premeditated Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>

            <p>HAving ſhewn in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Diſcourſe, that the wiſer Heathen had not only a knowledge of the true God, as the Creator and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the Univerſe, but a knowledge alſo of the Immortality of the Soul, and of a future State where good Men ſhould receive Rewards, and wicked Men due Puniſhments from the hands of God moſt juſt; it follows of courſe to be enquir'd into, how far this Belief of theirs
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100786:172"/>
might make them capable of ſuch Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or of Salvation. And here I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as a foundation, or firſt Principle to what ſhall follow; that the Efficient or Meritorious Cauſe of procuring Salvation to Mankind, can be no other but Jeſus Chriſt, who by his Obedience and Paſſion, hath redeemed good Men, and made them capable of Eternal Happineſs. Next, that all good Motions, vertuous Inclinations, and intellectual Improvements, are not acquirable by any Natural ſtrength, but by the help and concurrence of God. So St. <hi>Paul.</hi> ſays expreſsly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. where ſpeaking of the Heathen, he declares; how that <hi>which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhew'd it to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our preſent enquiry then will be of the inſtrumental Courſe, or of the means by which the Merits of Chriſt's Life and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be applied to Men, in order to their Salvation. For the more Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Proſecution of which Point 'twill be expedient to conſider, Firſt, The State of Mankind before the coming of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the State and Circumſtances of Mandkind after his coming. Before the coming of Chriſt, as hath been already ſhewn the Gentiles, though they had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Notions of the Nature and Perfections of a Deity, yet there is little or nothing
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100786:172"/>
extant which can countenance any Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had of ſuch a Deliverer, as we are now diſcourſing of: And as to the Jews for what appears from the Old Teſtament, they knew but little and obſcurely of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, as we have alſo before ſpoken-unto. They expected a Deliverer or Meſſiah 'tis true; but then they figur'd him to be a Temporal Conqueror, ſuch as <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſhould erect their Nation alſo into a vaſt Empire, and bring the World under their Subjection. A thing indeed which they earneſtly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, having been themſelves under heavy Oppreſſions for many Ages; Nay, ſo deep was this Opinion rooted in the Jews, that even the Diſciples of Chriſt, who were daily taught by and convers'd with him, could hardly be wean'd from this Belief, as appears by the Addreſs or Petition on the behalf of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they might ſit one on the right hand, and the other on the left hand of Chriſt in his Kingdom; as alſo from their conſtant enquiry of Chriſt, when he would reſtore the Kingdom or Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But this, as having been already diſcours'd of, and being a thing which will admit of little diſpute, I ſhall readily leave and paſs on to take a glance of Mankind after the coming of Chriſt, and his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Heaven.</p>

They who have had the Happineſs to be born within the Church, where the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Chriſtian Religion are ſuck'd in with their firſt Milk, and grow up into their Nature; ſuch I ſay, cannot but have a diſtinct knowledge of what the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion teacheth, concerning Chriſt and his Merits, ſo that if they do not act ſuitably to that knowledg, they are verily inexcuſable. But then for thoſe who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſuch an Education, nor ever heard of Chriſt or his Goſpel, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain true Notions of the Nature, Power, and Juſtice of God, and live juſtly and conformably to that knowledg, retaining a diſpoſition to receive farther Inſtruction with all propenſity to Vertue; I cannot ſee but that they may juſtly be ranked with thoſe great and wiſe Men amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, whether Philoſophers or others, in whoſe Lives and Writings we find ſo many remains of the true apprehenſions they had of a Deity, together with their great Pregnancy in Vertue. Now of both theſe ſorts of Men, whether before or after Chriſt, the queſtion will be the ſame; for as much as both were under the ſame State and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Natural Illumination and Moral Vertues.</p>
            <p>I know it is granted, and with very good reaſon too, that ſuch as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100786:173"/>
with the Patriarchs, though they were not of the ſame Lineage with <hi>Abraham,</hi> had ſuch a knowledge of the true God as made them capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such a one was <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> (of whom we read ſo great things;) ſuch a one alſo <hi>Job,</hi> who liv'd probably about the time of the firſt Patriarchs; for we read that he liv'd in the time of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> greatneſs; alſo <hi>Jethro,</hi> the Father-in-law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> having ſuch an extraordinary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Information of the Divine Will from the Mouth and Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and being himſelf alſo a Perſon of great Conduct and Wiſdom, as appears from Scripture, he could not but tranſmit the like Inſtructions to his Poſterity, as did <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> without all queſtion; the ſame likewiſe we may conclude of the deſcendents from <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and of his Off-ſpring by <hi>Keturah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it unuſual in thoſe days, whilſt Men liv'd under that unpoliſh'd but golden Age, for God to manifeſt his Will by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Revelation to wiſe Men, even long after the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as appears by the Hiſtory of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who though an Alien from the Houſe of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> had a free Communication with God upon occaſions of Moment, and propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as clearly of the coming of the Meſſiah,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100786:174"/>
as any other' of the Ancient Patriarchs and Prophets. Now for thoſe whoſe Doctrine and Actions are not recorded in ſacred Writ, as <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Solon, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus, Numa,</hi> and amongſt them, I know not why I may not reckon that ſtrenuous Defender of his Country's Liberty, <hi>Tullius, Ciccro;</hi> I ſay, theſe and many others of the ſame claſs, as they are known to have had noble Notions of the Deity, and to have been great and prudent Maſters in matters of Morality; ſo likewiſe are they famous for their own exemplary Lives and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are by the moſt impartial and learned Writers, held to be in a State of Salvation.</p>
            <p>But for ſuch of the wiſer and more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Gentiles who liv'd after Chriſt, Writers generally ſeem a little more ſevere, though in Truth, the ſame Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes favourably for both alike, it being no leſs difficult for many great Men of former Ages, though after Chriſt, to know the Hiſtory and Doctrine of Jeſus, as 'tis for any of the preſent Age to know the Tranſactions in the Dominions of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter John,</hi> or of the Emperour of <hi>China.</hi> Nay, much more difficult, for of theſe Countries ſo remote as they are, we have, by the help of Navigation and Commerce, ſome ſort of Account; but the Jews as
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100786:174"/>
they were to the <hi>Romans</hi> but an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of their Government, ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves held no ſuch Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication by Sea as now a-days, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with <hi>Germans, Dacians, Parthians, Indians,</hi> and the like, with whom they were in perpetual Hoſtility; and what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Kingdoms lay beyond theſe, were utterly unknown to them by any kind of Correſpondence: So that we may as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally conclude, that every Man now a-days is an ignorant Idiot, who does not know perhaps ſome new and great accident in <hi>Japan,</hi> or the Regions beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Moon, as that all were damn'd though otherwiſe never ſo wiſe and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who did not know the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, when yet we find how the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themſelves, who convers'd with Jeſus, were ignorant of the Nature of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, expecting a temporal Meſſiah, nor were they fully inſtructed till after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt; and even then too, we find <hi>Peter</hi> doubting whether it were lawfull to converſe with the Gentiles as appears by the caſe of <hi>Cornelius.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore that the Gentiles of this latter Age of the World, could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways of knowing the Chriſtian My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, but by ſuch ordinary methods as other matters of Fact are brought to Light,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100786:175"/>
which failing, the only <hi>Medium</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Information, muſt be by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Revealer.</p>
            <p>And this was the true State of the World, in the firſt Age of the Church, when the Diſciples of Jeſus, furniſh'd with ſupernatural Gifts and Graces, were made the Apoſtles and Meſſengers of theſe glad Tidings of Salvation; nor did they doe all this in one Age, but ſucceeding Ages and Nations became Converts to the Chriſtian Faith, as new Diſcoveries, and Men of an Apoſtolick Spirit did preſent themſelves, as all Hiſtories do teſtifie: This then being the greateſt Point in Controverſie, I ſhall endeavour to purſue it more fully, by ſuch Arguments as Natural Reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can afford us.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, that ſuch Men as we now ſpeak of, having not by any Means, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Information of the Chriſtian Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhould yet be capable of Salvation, is very inſonant to the Nature of an All-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and Righteous God, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Men for what was not in their Power to help, or if in their Power, they would have yielded all dutifull Compliance with it. Now as this is conſonant to God's Goodneſs, ſo is it not derogatory to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, conſidering, as I promis'd at firſt, that ſuch a knowledg of God and Practice of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100786:175"/>
Moral Vertues, as we find oftentimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentiles; are the Gifts of God, and not the Effects of Man's proper Will and Power; neither yet are they derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Merits of Chriſt, when we call to mind what was above promis'd; that Chriſt's Obedience and Paſſion, is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and meritorious Cauſe of Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo that Man's knowledge being only inſtrumental, whatſoever influence it has, it muſt be deriv'd alſo from God, and reſolv'd finally into the Merits of Chriſt, according to my firſt two Axioms or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulata's; let us argue then the Point a little cloſer: The King of <hi>England</hi> perhaps ſends a conſiderable Summ of Money, for the Redemption of all Engliſh Slaves through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Turkiſh Dominions; thoſe who hearing the joyfull News, readily embrace it with all imaginable Thankfulneſs, whilſt others hearing nothing of it ſit ſilent: now would it not ſeem very hard and unjuſt, that theſe ſhould be excluded from all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by this Act of Grace and Bounty, and left in perpetual Bondage, becauſe they did not lay hold of that which they never heard of, which yet doubtleſs they would have embrac'd alſo, with the ſame ſenſe of Gratitude with others, had they had the ſame notice; nay rather, do we not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count an unknown Act of Grace and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100786:176"/>
done to a Man, and before 'tis ſought for, to carry Characters of greater Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to lay a ſtronger Obligation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon the Receiver, when he ſhall come to have a knowledg of his moſt generous Benefactour. So that I doubt not, but <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Ariſtides, Epictetus,</hi> with other ſuch like Heroes, (whom without Blaſphemy or Hereſie, we may ſuppoſe capable of Mercy in the day of Judgment,) will exalt with great Joy, and celebrate the Praiſes of their gracious Redeemer, when they ſhall ſee him (though in the Clouds, yet) far more glorious than the Sun, and by whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Mercies they were brought into that luminous Region of Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And as this is the Voice of Reaſon, ſo alſo is it of the Holy Scriptures. The firſt is that of the <hi>11th</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where we read; that, <hi>he that cometh to God, muſt believe he is, and the Rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him.</hi> Now this belief many of the Heathens had, <hi>viz.</hi> of his Exiſtence, as alſo of a future State, where, after this Life, good Men ſhould be rewarded, and the Wicked Men puniſhed: we ſee then, that by theſe two Acts of Aſſent, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were ſaid to come to God, or to be admitted to his Favour and Grace, which yet cannot be verified of them, unleſs they
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100786:176"/>
be accounted capable of Salvation; nay, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this kind of coming to God, is called Faith, and ſuch a Faith, without which 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe him; when the Apoſtle tells us in the Context, <hi>That without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> ſubjoining it preſently as a Reaſon: <hi>For he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is,</hi> &amp;c. Another Argument from Scripture, is that Paſſage of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, <hi>Act</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> who though a Heathen, yet by his Alms and Prayers, and the devout Order he kept in his Family, procur'd the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, to have St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſent to him for his farther inſtruction. And of ſuch force and conviction was this Truth, that even St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, though the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, could not forbear to make an open profeſſion of it, ſaying, of a truth I find, that God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation, he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, (as did <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and many alſo of the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Gentiles,) is accepted of him. Nay St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Diſcourſe does imply, that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation there might be ſome, who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and wrought Righteouſneſs, and if ſo, of a certain truth, they are accepted of him. To theſe Places we may add, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies of himſelf, that though he had an hiſtorical Knowledg of the Life,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100786:177"/>
Doctrines and Sufferings of Jeſus, and was a violent Perſecuter of thoſe who believed on him, yet obtain'd Mercy, becauſe he did it in Ignorance and Unbelief, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. ought we therefore to exclude all from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy who never heard of Jeſus, and yet ſuch too, as would have been as ready as others to embrace him, and to ſuffer for him, had he been reveal'd unto them?</p>
            <p>The laſt Argument which I ſhall take from Scripture, is that of the 1ſt to the <hi>Romans: For the inviſible Things of him</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) from the Creation of the World, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the Things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead, ſo that they are without Excuſe.</hi> Here we ſee, that the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Gentiles not for Ignorance, or not Believing, but for their Idolatrous Worſhip, and not living conformably to that knowledg they had by the Works of the Creation of God's Eternity and Power, which Knowledg renders them inexcuſable; and yet they would have been excuſable, had not their Knowledg, join'd with a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worſhip of the ſame true God, been capable to have procur'd their Happineſs: For it would be unjuſt to condemn Men, for not doing of a thing, and yet condemn them too, although they doe it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good Life, join'd with their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100786:177"/>
muſt leave them with a reaſonable Excuſe, or make them capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in general Terms, that the Gentiles were Idolaters, and for that reaſon condemnable, as acting contrary to Knowledg; but that all the Gentiles thus acted contrary to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, does by no means follow from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s manner of expreſſing himſelf, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſual in Scripture, to ſpeak of all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and comprehenſive Terms, when ſuch as are or may be excepted, are very few in number: So the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> in the Term of that general Apoſtacy under <hi>Ahab</hi> exclaim'd, ſaying, that he alone was left of all the true Worſhipers of God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. But God tells him, that he had <hi>left in</hi> Iſrael 7000 <hi>Men, who had not bow'd the Knee to</hi> Baal; and even in <hi>Sodom,</hi> the moſt wicked Town that ever was upon the Earth, there was found a Righteous <hi>Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To put the Queſtion out of all diſpute, we have a moſt pregnant Proof from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his continuation of this Argument, 2 <hi>Rom. v.</hi> 10. pronouncing, <hi>Glory Honour, and Peace, to every one that worketh Good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile, for there is no reſpect of Perſons with God;</hi> (telling us alſo,) <hi>that not the Hearers, but that the Doers of the Law are juſtified before God: For</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:100786:178"/>
               <hi>when the Gentiles, who have not the Law,</hi> (that is, a reveal'd Written Law,) <hi>doe by Nature the Things contain'd in the Law, they having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſciences al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bearing witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. In this Place, St. <hi>Paul</hi> treating profeſſedly of the Law of Nature, by which the Gentiles did act, calls it the Law <hi>(viz.</hi> of God) written in their Hearts, and that acting according to the Dictates of this Law, they doe the Things contain'd in the Law, having the Teſtimony alſo of their Conſciences acquitting them for ſo doing; and therefore Doers of the Law, are juſtified in the ſight of God. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am the more confirm'd in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when I think upon that laſt great and final Sentence, which ſhall paſs on Men, at the general Judgment of the World: Many then ſhall make great Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Faith, ſaying; <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name,</hi> Mat. 7. <hi>and in thy Name caſt out Divels,</hi> &amp;c. But Chriſt knows them not, but tells them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. that becauſe they did not doe Works of Mercy towards their Brethren, (the ſuffering Members of Chriſt) they ſhould go into utter Darkneſs, but that thoſe who did ſhew compaſſion towards them, ſhould enter into Everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:100786:178"/>
Let us now ſee, what may be objected againſt this Diſcourſe: And firſt, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aſcenſion, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. ſays. <hi>He that believeth, and is Baptiz'd, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damn'd:</hi> Now, that thoſe who never heard of Chriſt, do not believe, is plain alſo (from 10th to the <hi>Rom.) How ſhall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard. and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> therefore no Salvation to thoſe who never heard of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To this Objection (which indeed carries the greateſt force of any thing that can be urg'd) I anſwer: Firſt, that Paſſage of the 16th of St. <hi>Mark, He that believeth not is damn'd,</hi> is not to be underſtood negatively, as though an Ignorance of Chriſt, and of his Doctrines, did certainly expoſe Men to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for then the Children of Chriſtian Parents, dying before they come of Age, to make an Act of Faith, would be damn'd: The Words then of this Place do include a poſitive Act of diſ-believing, or rejecting the Doctrines of Chriſt after they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd: This is evident from the Context in the precedent Verſe, where Chriſt gives Authority to his Diſciples; ſaying, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature; he that believeth and is Baptiz'd ſhall be ſav'd, but he that believeth</hi>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:100786:179"/>
               <hi>not ſhall be damn'd.</hi> So that they are damn'd, who after the Goſpel was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, did yet reject it, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not thoſe, who never heard of Chriſt, nor of his Goſpel</p>
            <p>This then doth ſuperſede that alſo of <hi>Rom.</hi> the 10th. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a poſitive and explicite Act of Faith, for <hi>v.</hi> the 9th he ſaith; that <hi>if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thy Heart, that God raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſav'd:</hi> Now as ſuch a Faith cannot be attain'd, but by the preaching of the Goſpel, or from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation, ſo neither doth it follow from hence, that all who have not receiv'd this joyfull Tidings of the Goſpel, ſhall not be ſav'd. He that is a great Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt, is generally reckon'd to be a learned Man, and yet from thence it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he who is not a great Linguiſt, is not a learned Man; upon the whole, the Senſe of the Apoſtle amounts to no more but this; that they who by the hearing of God's Word, or of Teachers, ſhall arrive to a knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt their Saviour, and believe his Reſurrection, are in a State of Salvation, <hi>quoad Antecedens,</hi> in reſpect of the means; but <hi>quoad Conſequens,</hi> or the effect, that all ſuch ſhall actually be ſav'd, is no way aſcertain'd from the foremention'd
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100786:179"/>
place. We read every where in Scripture, of thoſe who make ſhipwrack of their Faith, and of falling from the Faith: and when we are exhorted to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the Faith, this does imply a poſſibility of lapſing: Nor is it any thing to the purpoſe to ſay, that no Man, who has once embrac'd the true Faith, can fall from it; for the Faith which the Apoſtles exhorts us to ſtand ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in, is doubtleſs the True Faith. In like manner at the 13 <hi>v.</hi> of the ſame 10th Chap. to the <hi>Romans</hi> we read, that <hi>whoſoever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> and yet <hi>Matth.</hi> 7th we read, <hi>Not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the Will,</hi> &amp;c. So that all ſuch Places are not to be underſtood Mathematically, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſuch as cannot be otherwiſe; but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or as to the general, being attended with a good Life, and good Works of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity.</p>
            <p>But it may be farther objected, <hi>John</hi> the 3d. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> ſo that Salvation cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm, but they who never heard of Chriſt, could never be Baptiz'd into Chriſt, and muſt be therefore excluded Salvation. To this I anſwer, that Baptiſm under the Goſpel, is the ſame with Circumciſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100786:180"/>
the Law, this being a Type of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both of them a Sign or Seal of a Covenant of Mercy. But in the time of the Law, we read of many who were not Circumcis'd, ſuch as <hi>Job, Melchiſedech, Lot,</hi> and others, of whoſe Salvation we can in no ways doubt; the Females alſo amongſt the Jews were uncapable of Circumciſion, and yet we doubt not but great Numbers of them were ſav'd; ſo likewiſe ſince the time of the Goſpel, we may charitably believe, that the Children of Chriſtian Parents who dyed before Baptiſm, may be capable of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation alſo. 2. The foremention'd place therefore is of the ſame Latitude with that of <hi>John</hi> the 16th. <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you;</hi> from which place, ſome of the Ancients, and the Greeks to this day, hold the Euchariſt neceſſary to Infants; but notwithſtanding that the form of Words be the ſame in both Places, yet we do not believe, that Children are oblig'd to come to the Lord's Supper; and even Men who dye immediately after Baptiſm, are undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſav'd, though they were never Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Communion.</p>
            <p>It has been a Maxim, I know amongſt the Ancients, that <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus,</hi> which throughout all Ages (with due Reverence do I ſpeak it) hath been
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100786:180"/>
by many ſo ſtrain'd and ſtretch'd, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraitened and confin'd, as to exclude all other Chriſtians alſo from Salvation, who are not of the ſame Communion with themſelves; Nay, even amongſt us of this Age and Nation, we have a ſort of Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Cenſorious, Prick-ear'd Hypocrites, who will hardly believe any to have a true Call, who are not of their own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, Siſterhood, I might ſay: For their Devotion leans, or rather lies much that way. The former Maxim then (with all ſubmiſſion to the venerable aſſerters of it) does not ſo much concern thoſe who never were within the Communion of the Church, as them who having been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times within its Boſome, are afterwards cut off by Excommunication, and ejected out of it for Schiſm, Hereſie, or ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous crimes, as the practices of all Ages do amply teſtifie, though which of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties was in the right, or was the true Church, was many times a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of endleſs Diſpute. Emulation and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Animoſities being oftentimes the Cauſe and Fomenter of ſuch ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And to ſhew that this is the true ſenſe of the foremention'd Maxim, I would only ask of what Communion were the <hi>Magi,</hi> or the wiſe Men in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who came to worſhip Chriſt? Not of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100786:181"/>
Synagogue certainly, nor of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who were Baptiz'd into the Chriſtian Faith. And yet no Man doubts but that they who were the firſt to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt with their rich Offerings, and came ſo long a Journey, were made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Benefits of his Life and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh Church was a Type of the Chriſtian, and much narrower, whether we conſider its Dimenſions or the Terms of its Communion; for they were under ſtricter Covenants of Salvation and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, under divers Burthenſome Ordinances, and more eſpecially oblig'd to Circumciſion; and yet by God's ſpecial Mercy, great numbers were ſav'd, who were ſtrangers to the Church. For beſides, ſuch aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd as <hi>Job, Melchiſedech,</hi> and others, with their Families, we read of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the greateſt City in the World, together with its King, the moſt Potent Temporal Prince then reigning upon the Earth, that upon the Preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> they turn'd from their evil way to the true God, with ſuch humility and ſeverity of Repentance as we no where read the like. For even their very Cattle were oblig'd to faſt, and were cloath'd with Sack-cloth: Now can we think that all they whom God by ſuch an eſpecial care did call to Repentance,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100786:181"/>
and who teſtified ſuch an univerſal and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Obedience to his heavenly Will, were deliver'd only from Temporal judgements, to be afterwards overwhelm'd all of them with Eternal Torments? But it may be ſaid, that this was an Extraordinary Caſe, and ſo ſay I too. The ordinary and ſafeſt way to Salvation, is by a belief on Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Myſteries, and by the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the obſervance of Evangelical Duties. But notwithſtanding, God who may and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth diſpenſe with his own Methods, may in ſome extraordinary Caſes ſhew Mercy to a few, and call them by ſome ſpecial means unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, it may be alleadg'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, That the works of the beſt Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathens, cannot be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God; for as much as they want Charity. Now Charity is one of the Graces of God's holy Spirit, not acquirable, but inſus'd under the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel. 'Tis true, Charity is an excellent Grace, and the nobleſt of all thoſe which we are capable to receive from the inſpiration of God's holy Spirit; for other Graces tend chiefly to the private benefit of him on whom they are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but Charity is a Ray of the divine Beauty and Excellence, and dilates it ſelf
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100786:182"/>
in the good of others, extending it ſelf through the whole World without the leaſt proſpect of advantage to it ſelf. It carries the Soul as on the Wings of a Cherubim into the divine Preſence, where contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating its own unworthineſs in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perfection and Goodneſs of God, it ſallies out into Acts of Admiring and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and thinks all too little for an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful and Omnipotent Creatour. Now if the Heathens had Speculations of this kind, (though imperfect ones, but ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the means of knowledge,) I cannot ſee why they might not exert them by ſome efforts, which might hold a kind of Analogy with thoſe purer Emanations of that true flaming Charity, which is no ways attainable, but by the free Grace and infuſion of the Holy Ghoſt; for though the better Heathens did not always do good works (or perhaps but ſeldom) with a reference of them to God, as the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end and chiefeſt good; yet for as much as they propos'd good by what they did, and practis'd Vertue for its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſole Intention of a good end (without farther reward) was an implicite devolution of the action it ſelf upon God, as the firſt Mover and grand Scope to which it tended. And if to make an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good, it be requiſite that the Agent
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100786:182"/>
have God always before his Eyes, ſome good works even of the beſt Chriſtians, will be found defective upon this account; for even the beſt of Men may many times do good works, becauſe they are good, not thinking of God, the Original of all good, and into whom, as into the Ocean, all ſtreams of Goodneſs at laſt return.</p>
            <p>The ſumm of what I have hitherto ſpoken upon this Argument does amount to this; That an explicite Belief of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Chriſtian Religion, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an Oral Confeſſion, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, though they be points of greateſt Moment, and exceeding helpfull, and the only ſafe way to Man's Salvation, yet are they not ſo abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary, but that 'tis poſſible, in ſome extraordinary caſes, Salvation may be obtain'd where theſe are wanting.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Doctrine of the poſſibility of Salvation for the Gentiles, in ſuch form as hath been already ſtated, without its Abettours, even amongſt the moſt learned and impartial, ſuch as <note n="a" place="margin">in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. dei. l. 18. c. 47.</note>

            <p>But on which ſide ſoever the Truth doth lie, it is not a point of that moment as to diſſolve the Bond of Charity amongſt Chriſtians, eſpecially when Charity, the very Bond of Perfection, inclines us to take ſide with Mercy. God's Mercy is his Triumphant Attribute, <hi>the Lord Merciful</hi>

               <hi>and Gracious, long ſuffering and of great goodneſs,</hi> is the old Stile, and that by which God proclaim'd his greatneſs, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 3. 4.) and whoſoever ſhall conſider the ineffable Myſtery of the Son of God's Incarnation; as alſo the Redemption of the World by his moſt holy Life, dolorous Paſſion, and glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but feel ſome holy Flames of divine Love, whoſe light may extend it ſelf to the Gentiles. Nay, though the Opinion which I have been now defending were falſe, yet is it not dangerous or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<hi>:</hi> For the Belief even of a Falſhood, to ſuch as are not convinc'd that it is ſo, may be pious and praiſe worthy. 'Tis certainly praiſe worthy and pious for a Man to believe his Parents or Benefactours to be happy in Heaven, and yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they may be in the number of the Reprobate. Of all Men, Chriſtians cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are in the happieſt Eſtate, when we conſider the aſſiſtance they have from the Goſpel, and yet are they in the unhappieſt ſtate too upon the ſame Conſideration, for where much is given, much will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</p>
            <p>Great and infinite are the Advantages which the Goſpel offers; we are there taught in what a dangerous Eſtate we are in by Nature, we are taught alſo by whom
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100786:184"/>
we are deliver'd from danger, and how we may have the benefit of ſuch Deliverance: We have Holy Sacraments to purge our Sins, and to encreaſe our Grace, we have many glorious Examples of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to encourage us, and moſt heavenly Precepts, by which to govern our Lives; we have the recompenſe of Reward in ſight, and Promiſes of Help, both for our Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Furtherance in the way.</p>
            <p>The Church, which is abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with all theſe means, may juſtly be compar'd to a well built Ship, in which are all ſorts of Proviſions requiſite for a long Voyage. Suppoſe we then, that a Man were to take his Voyage into a new World (as indeed we are all going thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a ſpiritual ſenſe) and that wanting the convenience of a good Veſſel, well rigg'd and furniſh'd, he ſhould ſet forth upon his ſtrength, or perhaps embark himſelf upon ſome poor, ſhatter'd, leaking Boat or Junc, ſuch as are in uſe amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> 'tis ten thouſand to one, but ſuch a Man muſt periſh, though 'tis not utterly impoſſible, but that with great care and difficulty, and by God's ſingular Providence, he may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive thither with ſafety; and for ought we know, the new World, I mean <hi>America,</hi> was Peopled ſome ſuch way, admitting <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood to have been univerſal; ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100786:184"/>
find from any Records of Antiquity, that Navigation after the Deluge was in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perfection, but that Men of that and of ſome ſucceeding Ages, conſidering how they had eſcap'd the dangers of the Waters, were fearfull to commit themſelves to the boundleſs Ocean, not daring ſo much, as to put to Sea for a long time after, and that too by little and little, as Experience encourag'd them to make farther Trial. The Emblem holds good Analogy with the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age we are all making into the other World: This Life is the Sea, where we are expos'd to Tempeſts and Fatigues; we have a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Gulf under us, and many Rocks, Quick-Sands, and Hurry-canes ever and anon threatning to deſtroy us, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the good Proviſion with which the Ship is fraught; if we live not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and with good conduct, we may fall ſhort of the deſired Countrey, whilſt others by God's ſingular Providence and Mercy, though deſtitute of ſuch helps, may find an extraordinary deliverance, as we find ſometimes to have happened to ſuch, as putting to Sea ill provided, and for a long time given over for loſt, have after all their dangers arriv'd ſafely to the Haven.</p>
            <p>Put the Caſe we were upon a Voyage to <hi>America</hi> (or the New World, as we call it,) and that others alſo ſhould be bound
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100786:185"/>
for the ſame Coaſt, but not perhaps in the ſame Bottom, who though they ſhould ſail at ſome diſtance from us, yet ought we to have compaſſion on them, and ſo much the more, the greater ſhould their diſtance be, and the weaker the Ship which carried them; and if we could not take them into our own Veſſel, at leaſt we were bound to ſuccour them, as far as we were able, and where that could not be done, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the Mercy of Almighty God. But inſtead of theſe Offices of Humanity, if we ſhould denie them Succour, nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps turn Pyrats and fall upon them, and make them Prize, and condemn all the Paſſengers to Chains and Slavery; would not ſuch Proceedings ſeem very inhumane, and might we not fear, that a juſtly exaſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated God, might bring our own Ship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome fatal Diſtreſs, before it ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the Land 'twas bound for: The Parallel is obvious.</p>
            <p>Charity, is an Heroick and Divine Grace, in the Judgment of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> far exceeding all other Gifts, how excellent ſoever; nay, even Faith and Martyrdom, without it, would be to little purpoſe. The Gifts of Propheſies and Tongues ſhall ceaſe; and Knowledg, like a Dream, ſhall vaniſh; for we know but in part, and that like the reflection of Images from a brittle
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100786:185"/>
Glaſs: But Charity is of a permanent and Celeſtial Nature, it hopeth all things, it boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not it ſelf, it ſeeketh not its own but another's good, and of the three Graces, though it be rank'd in the laſt place, yet is it, by the Apoſtle, accounted the firſt and greateſt of them. If we look into the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of the World, we ſhall ever find thoſe to have been the braveſt, who were moſt diffuſive of their Goodneſs, and the wider they extended their Compaſſion and Bounty, the greater Honours were they ever thought worthy of. This greatneſs of Mind, in doing good to all, not that ſwelling Ambition of enlarging it ſelf by Dominion and Empire, was that in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made Men Heroes, and in ſome ſort Partakers of the Divine Nature; whereas private Ends, with thoughts and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances which terminate in our own good only, have been ever accounted Characters of a narrow and ſtraitened Mind.</p>

            <p>THE great Scope of this whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, through all the precedent Chapters, has been to combat Atheiſm and Irreligion, or Profaneſs, from the Light of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100786:186"/>
Nature, which not only ſhews us the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a God, but that the moſt perfect and pureſt Worſhip, by which a Creature is capable to expreſs his Adoration, is moſt juſtly due unto him. The Exiſtence of a God is diſcover'd to us from the Theory of Nature, from Principles of Reaſon, and from the Eminent Teſtimonies of the beſt Men in all Ages. By the ſame Light we diſcover alſo ſome of the Attributes of God, indeed ſo Eſſential, that they are incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to any other Being, and ſerve to prove both the Unity, as well as the Verity of the Godhead. Theſe I have briefly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, foraſmuch as they are every where copiouſly and clearly handled by ſuch, as write upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>The conſiderations of God, in relation to his Creatures, do afford us a larger field of Matter to travel in, whether we reflect upon his Works, or the Worſhip he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us. The grand Work of Creation, is as demonſtrable as any thing in Nature, from the impoſſibility of a fortuitous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the World, out of a pre-exiſtent Chaos, and from an Incorruptibility of an Eternity of Matter with that of the God-head; ſo that the very Creation of the World out of nothing, is another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Verity and Unity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:100786:186"/>
But God's conſerving Power or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, being that we daily Experiment, and by which we have ſo near and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a dependance on him, even in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in all our Actions, is a Point of great Importance alſo, and capable of a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Diſcourſe; whether we conſider the Works of Nature in general, or Humane Affairs, in the regard they have either to publick Societies and Kingdoms, or to the particular Concerns of private Men. That God's Providence is concern'd in all theſe, and has an influence upon the Revolutions of Kingdoms is unqueſtionable: What Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Inferences may be drawn from hence, is a Matter of more diſpute, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have endeavour'd to ſhew, that God's determination or ordering of theſe Affairs, is no Argument to prove them to be always good, ſo as to juſtifie the Inſtrument, by which ſuch his Purpoſes are brought to paſs. We have ſeen in <hi>tranſitu</hi> what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence God's free Knowledg has on future Actions, and how far Man may be a free Agent, notwithſtanding ſuch Preſcience or Decrees of God.</p>
            <p>What hitherto has been ſpoken of, are Points of ſpeculation; that which follows, and is ſo neceſſary alſo to be known of God concerns Practice, being no other than our Duty to him, which is his Worſhip. We
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100786:187"/>
have ſeen how the Gentiles, and that all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Kingdoms of the World, ever held a Divine Worſhip, to be due from them, though almoſt all of them were Idolaters, and ſuperſtitious in ſuch Worſhip, placing it on falſe Gods; and thoſe few amongſt them, who by the Light of Nature, were directed to the Worſhip of the true God, were yet very ignorant of the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; ſuch a Worſhip being to be known only by Divine Revelation. And although all the Heathen Law-givers and Founders of Religion pretended to receive their Precepts from ſome kind of Deity, and by Revelation, yet foraſmuch as all ſuch Deities were notoriouſly falſe, and their Superſtition long ſince vaniſh'd out of the World, we ought not to give them a place amongſt the Founders of reveal'd Worſhip; and therefore we have conſider'd ſuch reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip, as is at this day in Vogue, having for its Object the true God, and which make claim alſo to divine Revelation: Of which</p>
            <p>The firſt is the Jewiſh, touching whoſe Original, there is no diſpute amongſt any Profeſſors of Religion at this day extant in the World; for both Chriſtians, as well as Mahometans, do acknowledg <hi>Moſes</hi> to have receiv'd his Laws from God; and that the Jews were a People ſet apart by God for
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100786:187"/>
his peculiar Worſhip, appears abundantly from the preſervation of that little Nation, and of their Rites amidſt all the Kingdoms of the Earth which ſurrounded them, and held them in ſubjection; from whom, as they differ'd extremely in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo was it impoſſible, but their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould have been drown'd in that Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Superſtition which encompaſs'd them (conſidering alſo their frequent Apoſtaſies, Perſecutions, and Inclinations to Idolatry,) had they not been upheld by a Divine Power, from whom their Religion was deriv'd.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, their Religion was but Temporary, and to determine in the Meſſiah, to whom alſo all the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Old Teſtament, all the Rites, Ceremonies, and Sacrifices had an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate regard, as Types and Figures, in whom alſo they were all fully verified and accompliſh'd; which Meſſiah, was no other but Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the true Saviour, not only of the Jews, but of all other Nations, and who alſo was and is the Authour and Preſerver of the Chriſtian Religion, which God was pleas'd to reveal by him, as the only ſafe and ſecure way to everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. This has been the chief Subject of this Book, and the Truth hereof has been demonſtrated, not only from the Types and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100786:188"/>
Propheſies of the Old Teſtament, but from the Life, Doctrine, and Miracles of Jeſus; to which may be added, the miraculous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Succeſs, this Doctrine met with in the Converſion of the World.</p>
            <p>The Mahometan Sect, had for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who alſo pretended to divine Revelation; but for what appears of him, how wide ſoever he has extended his Dominion, he was no other than a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impoſtor, whoſe Paradiſe was Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and his Religion Empire.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe of the Soul's Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, was a natural Reſult from the former Conſiderations, of which alſo the better and more learned Heathens had a belief, no leſs than of the Exiſtence of God, and of a Providence: From all which Premiſes by an unavoidable Sequel of Reaſon, we were led on to enquire, what Benefits ſuch Heathens were capable to receive from this kind of Knowledge, concluding according to the dictates of Charity, that they were not all excluded from Salvation through the Merits and Satisfaction of Chriſt, whom they never had the means to underſtand; for though they not the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, (which can be no other but what is reveal'd,) yet having a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God from the Light of Nature, that Knowledge, by God's Mercy,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100786:188"/>
with a Life ſuitable thereunto, might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them capable of future Bliſs.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Light of Nature, like that of the Star to the <hi>Magi,</hi> may conduct the Gentiles to the Nativity of Chriſt, and of his Religion, where vaniſhing at the riſing of the Sun, even that of Righteouſneſs, which does illuminate and quicken the World with its ſalutiſerous Beams, we muſt be now contented to loſe our mid-night Guide, in that glorious Luminary of the Day, whoſe benign Influence, does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quicken all it ſhines upon, but gives an orient Luſtre to it and diſcovers to us great and noble Proſpects, ſome more remote and diſtant, and others near at hand.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing which occurs to our view from the Light of the Goſpel, is the Church, which preſents it ſelf ſomething in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a fair Foreſt, wherein are all ſorts of Trees and Plants, ſome bearing good Fruit, ſome bad, with numberleſs Rocks and ſtumbling Stones, together with Thorns and Briars; where we may obſerve alſo divers large Roads, with many By-ways and Paths croſſing and winding with in one another, in manner of a Labyrinth. Beyond this we have two vaſt and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Proſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> one of a moſt glorious Region, lying in a moſt ſweet and ſerene Air, and crown'd with a moſt beautifull
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100786:189"/>
City, the whole Country being adorn'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where with infinite variety of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rivulets, of Fruit-Trees, Gardens, Groves, odoriferous Flowers and Plants, with whatſoever there is in Nature, which may refreſh and charm the weary and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Traveller. The other Proſpect, as of a Region quite different from the former, being cover'd continually with a pitchy Smoak, mixt with Gletes of ſulphurous Flames, which do not only threaten to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Sun, but with their noiſome and bituminous Smells, accompanied with loud Groans and Howlings, fill the Eyes and Ears of the beholder with as great a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as the other Region-does affect him with Admiration and Delight.</p>
            <p>Now ſo it is, that whoſoever would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to that glorious Region before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, muſt paſs through this Foreſt, where are many wild Beaſts and Serpents, many hollow, dark Grots or Dens; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſs Paths turning and winding one within another, make the Paſſage very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and dangerous; ſo that the Traveller will be in Peril of falling into inextricable Perplexities, without the help of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Guide. And truly whoſoever tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels this way, it will not be long before he ſhall find a Guide, offering himſelf to be his Convoy; ſaying, Sir, if you pleaſe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100786:189"/>
to follow me, I will undertake to furniſh you with what is neceſſary for this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and bring you ſafe to that delightfull Country which you ſee before you, though afar off, and whither you deſire to arrive. No, ſays another Guide, believe him not, for he will but trapan you, and carry you to that gloomy Region of Darkneſs and Horrour; but if you pleaſe to truſt your ſelf with me, I'll engage to conduct you a new, ſafer, and ſhorter way, than any which hath hitherto been found out. Matters ſtanding in this debate, the curious Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, cannot but ſtand amaz'd too; but how will he be diſtracted, when he ſhall find theſe Guides, inſtead of lending him their charitable help, to fall a quarelling with one another, to that degree, as to exchange Blows, not only wounding, but dragging one another through the Thorns and Briars, through Thick and Thin, to that black Stygian Kingdom, where diſmal Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Torments reign eternally? Such an Entertainment at a Man's firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on his Journey, is enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, and make him draw back his Foot, and ſeek ſome other means to conduct him Heaven-ward. And yet this he cannot doe without manifeſt Peril.</p>

fixing them on that beautiful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom we are going to, whoſe ſight the the nearer we approach to it, will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully refreſh us, and make us double our Pace. Sometimes alſo let us look downwards towards our feet, for fear of ſtumbling; for we ſhall meet with many rugged paſſages and ſtops in our Travel. But above all, let us remember that the Prince to whom this delightfull Country doth belong, will refreſh us in our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not only with ſuitable Proviſions, but with the directions and conſolations of his Embaſſadour, even the holy Spirit. So that being thus provided for our Voyage, let us ſet forwards in an humble reliance upon the all-ſufficiency and goodneſs of him who invites us to him.</p>
            <p>Let us not be diſheartned for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers of the way, nor ſean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd for the contention amongſt the Guides; for 'tis no more than what the King himſelf, to whoſe Country we are going, has long ſince foretold us, <hi>viz.</hi> that many falſe Guides or Prophets ſhall ariſe with many great Seducers, who ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend alſo to be Chriſt: He has told us, that his Church here on Earth, is like a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Field, in which he, the good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, did ſow pure Grain, but whilſt the Labourers ſlept, the Enemy ſowed his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100786:191"/>
Tares. Theſe Tares then of Contention and Diſputation, are of the Enemy's ſowing, and ſprang up preſently after the good Corn, and will continue growing in the Field till the Harveſt of the World. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall endeavour to deſtroy them, will in all likelihood tread down the good Grain alſo; and ſince they cannot prevent the Enemies malice, 'tis the duty of the Labourers when they ſow good Grain to be watchfull, and to nip theſe ſpreading weeds at their firſt appearance; for they are of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and devouring Nature, robbing all the good Juyce and Nutriment to themſelves, and by the many windings of their Wyres, they pluck the Stalks of good Corn down to the Ground. There is nothing certainly more pernicious to the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Religion, than frequent diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about it; for though many at firſt, out of an itch of Oſtentation, may enter upon a Diſpute, yet they ſeldom quit it but with great Animoſity, and by their endleſs controverſies, bring the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion, and the Articles of our Faith under Scepticiſm and Doubt.</p>
            <p>Happy were the Patriarchs of the firſt Age, without diſpute, whoſe Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in an Adoration of Almighty God their Creator. They never troubled their Brains with Metaphyſical Quiddities
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100786:191"/>
and Diſtinctions; 'twas their early buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the morning to make their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to the God of Heaven for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of their ſins, and thereby make him propitious. They did celebrate his Praiſes in ſome ſhort pious Hymns, expreſſing his Greatneſs and Goodneſs, and afterwards betaking themſelves to the ordinary Duties of their Life, which were for the moſt part paſtoral; they could not but make infinite improvements of their time, by obſerving the Power and Goodneſs of their Maker, in the bountifull returns from the Earth, and by obſerving dayly the Beauties of Nature, with the Viciſſitudes of Seaſons, and the favourable influence of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. The Works of God were the ſubject of their innocent Speculation, whoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo they tranſmitted to Poſterity, by telling, what deliverances their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo they themſelves had found at his hands. Meditations and Diſcourſes like theſe, did interſere commonly in all the Employments and Occurrences of their Lives; and thus by an innocent Labour of Body, and by Methods of Sobriety, Temperance, and Frugality, unknown to thoſe of this luxurious and degenerate Age, they did arrive to length of days, retaining to the laſt an uninterrupted Health and Vegeteneſs of Mind; and when
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100786:192"/>
Nature had ſpun its courſe, they did wind up their Lives by recommending their Spirits into the hands of their Creator, and ſlept with their Fathers, leaving their Children to follow their good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thus far'd it with the happy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs.</p>
            <p>And truly, under the Goſpel, I cannot ſee, but Men may be as happy, nay more happy if they pleaſe; the Duties which Chriſt requires of us, carry their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, tending all of them to the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Moral Law, and to ſettle the Spirit upon a true Baſis of repoſe. The Articles of Faith, as they are tender'd to us in the Goſpel, are few; and to an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unprejudic'd Mind, carry light and life with them, although diſputations and heterodox Queſtions may ariſe in the Church, and embroil many with Faction and perplex'd Notions, what is this to a modeſt and humble Chriſtian? The practice of whoſe life conſiſts, Firſt, in a dutiful Adoration of Almighty God, expecting Salvation from him through the Merits of his only Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning up himſelf wholly to his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and being always thankful under every circumſtance of life. Secondly, in performing works of Juſtice and Charity towards his Neighbour: and laſtly, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100786:192"/>
ſoberly as to himſelf, and bringing his extravagant Paſſions and deſires under ſubjection. Let not ſuch a one diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Reſt, by endeavouring to fathom the inexhauſtible depths of Knowledge with intricate and fruitleſs Enquiries, which indeed are thoſe Thorns and Thiſtles from whence Men ſhall never gather Grapes nor Figs; they who fall amongſt them will be entangled with their prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Snares. No, let a Man live ſo as to have a care of himſelf, and to hope the beſt of another; and thus, being freed from ſuperfluous Anxiety, he will go through with the Duties of Life, and even of Death, with great alacrity, having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to a true Settlement and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind.</p>
